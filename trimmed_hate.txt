I subscribed !    do I get an upvote?
I hate psychology.  It's a brainwashing gimmick to make us fit in.
Damn, I literally studied cognitive behavioral therapy for one of my collegecel assignments today. Triggered.
Of course!
I completely agree, friend. It has nothing to do with health and everything to do with normality. 
Sorry for triggering you, friend. Just love high-quality memes!
That's a very interesting question.  I'm inclined to say yes. For all of his talk of a "superman", Nietzsche had more than a few incel traits.
He had a lot of health problems and ended up living with his mother so I would assume no woman wanted him so I'd say yes.
the only thing is, I think he died of syphilis
Opps then I was wrong...
Would it be possible to repost very intellectual r/incels threads here? We could link back to the originals of course, or better yet invite the authors over to post them themselves and discuss. I'm thinking especially about the recent natural treatise on the blackpill.
That's a very good idea!  This sub's all about preserving the best parts of incel culture, so it makes sense to share neat incel things we've found in other communities.
This has been tried.  /r/IncelDiscussions  The problem is that intelligence is almost extinct by now. 
Great! I pmed the guy who wrote the treatise about this sub.
I think the main thing about r/IncelDiscussions is that people viewed it as dry and unpleasant. I think we can have an intelligent incel subreddit that's still a fun place to hang out.
While I don't agree with its overall conclusions, this is a very high-quality post. Marx and Engels touched on sexual relations quite a bit (Marx less so) and I think their original analysis still mostly holds up today, with some updates.
"The bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women. He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production. "
Exactly. Look at Western degenerate culture, the pornography industry, the fashion industry which leads to anorexia and so on - not to mention the related spheres of how the perceived beauty of white women (and whiteness as a whole) is used to demean and belittle non-white women.  Mainstream Western culture is inherently Chad-Bourgeois, it views women through the lens of the stereotypical Chad - a fratboy who wants to count up his next drunken "conquests." It is obvious that Sexual Capitalism and the hyper-sexualization of women can lead only to their debasement, which reveals an interesting reality - the only ones who benefit from Sexual Capitalism are Chads.  As a materialist I do not condone religion, but Islamic and similar societies uplifted women by destroying Sexual Capitalism. By removing female sexualization from society and restricting sexual market choice, not only are sub-8 males integrated into society, but women are judged by their accomplishments rather than by their looks. 
Out of curiosity, why do you disagree with the conclusions?   I assume your name is unironic and you are an anarchist, in which case may I ask how an anarchist society would solve inceldom? It seems to be that "anarchist" societies would fall into the libertarian trap and devolve into capitalism, which is a common Marxist critique of them; I would wager they fall into Sexual Capitalism immediately - sexual free choice is almost built into the idea!
Is FHO also used here or is this like FA / IWH
Tigger: "Just kidding. I'm not terrified of modern psychiatry. [DBT](https://behavioraltech.org/resources/faqs/dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt/) got me where I am today. Thank God we're not Eeyore."  Pooh: "You shouldn't make fun of him. He probably just needs an ear and some good advice. Or maybe the right medicine."  Tigger:"Yeah, I thought that too, until that new frog friend of his came around and banned everyone from thinking happy thoughts. What was his name?"  Pooh: "Azavii. Such an odd name."  Tigger: "At least it's not Scientology."  Pooh: "I think even that might be an improvement over "Lie Down and Rot." Not to mention all those other horrid things, that I hope Christopher Robin doesn't ever hear. I'd rather just lie down and be happy with this honey pot. Whether I'm ever putting my parts in other people's pouches or not."  Tigger:"Yeah, some of my playtimes with Mrs. Roo have been getting weird ever since that boy hit puberty."
I don't use the term, but I won't stop anyone else.
I take influences from both anarchist and Marxist writers.  I disagree with the conclusions because I think the idea of a "sexual marketplace" is wildly removed from the class struggle and places the central conflict on men vs women and not the ruling class vs the ruled classes.
NEET nation when?
Also, seems exceedingly likely with this information that we're going to have UBI some time in the near future. The NEET lifestyle will become the norm. How will society feel the impacts of this? My forecast: Not good.
Technology is degenerating along with the rest of modern culture.  The whole rotten system will collapse soon, and the NEETs will starve as they should. 
What kind of Anarchist are you comrade? Are you on the spectrum?
When a significant portion of the population has been rendered productively useless (and 50% is significant, I think!), the ruling class will resort to very "uncouth" solutions. War and genocide, for example. Systematic industrial extermination campaigns.  With the next global economic crash coming in a few years, I'm more than a little afraid of what sort of geopolitical tangles we might see forming.
I tend to just call myself a "socialist". I've sort of combined elements of a lot of different tendencies. My favorite works are by Nechayev, Marx/Engels, Kropotkin, Lenin, Trotsky, and Orwell.  And yeah, I'm on the autistic spectrum, if that's what you mean.
Do you agree with Marx’s view on women?  I’m kinda dark blue pilled. Since I know how humans act when they see something attractive vs ugly.  But I’m still happy because it shows me almost nobody knows how romance works So I’m happy that women have freedom since it shows that I wouldn’t truly be loved if I was in a patriarchal society. I would just be beta bucks.   So am I save here?
To your last question, of course you're safe here! Even the normiest of the normies are safe here and it seems obvious you're not a normie.  And yeah, I'm more or less an orthodox Marxist in regard to sexism. Reading the Origin of the Family, Property, and the State completely changed my worldview. It helped me understand the training of men and women to fit specific economic functions via gender roles, which I'd always had an intuition about but had never been able to put into words.
Thanks. It just seemed that it would be another place where the requirement was a vantablack pill.   Edit. In fact I have a twitter account where I show my more SJW side with some snark of course. 
The problem isn't the ruling class.  The problem is modern culture and all members of it who are degenerate morons.  Look at your typical reddit poster as an example.  Such people cannot sustain civilization. 
Women are the ruling class.  Even if you look at stats like "99% of all CEOs are rich white males" or whatever, most of them are married, and most of them are, therefore, in a position of subservience to their wives, who can simply divorce them and run off w/ the pelf at any time.  It's due to the depoliticization and anihilation of male class consciousness by females that men actually sort of swallow this "women don't get to be CEOs, they just get to _marry_ CEOs and rob them blind in divorce!"  And et sic. for positions lower than "CEO."  The small number of women who marry men who make less than them are prob. statistically insignificant.  The ruling class often tries to replace its power over its serfs as a "duty to bring them up rightly."  The nobility did not oppress peasants in feudal society; they simply ensured through religion and other stupefaction that the peasants had "manners."  Women indoctrinate children into lacking class-consciousness, because mothers are the root of indoctrination into obedience to class---a child that is "properly socialized" in our gynocracy will learn to show deference and submission to all women, not just its mother.  The mothers of friends become stand-in mothers who are also owed obedience.  The red herring of "patriarchy" is simply an attempt at obfuscation---the overwhelming data show that childhood socialization is conducted by women.    We live in a gynocracy, but the OP is incorrect to identify Chad w/ the ruling class---maybe prior to the "rule of law" and other devices, the strongest male Chad was the ruler of the tribe, but in modern society, and I would suggest all societies w/ female nobility, those who come out on top are females.  Even male Chads in feudal societies were expected to work, to defend the city gates, etc. etc.  It's their wives who were expected to do _nothing_, other than have children.  And even that isn't like "having children" for poor people in capitalist society, where you do see females doing work.  In the upper classes, the woman doesn't change the diapers, nanny does that.  The woman doesn't even nurse in some cultures, a wet-nurse does.  The central conflict of the class struggle is that women depoliticize their children; they are trained to think that their mothers love them, rather than that their mothers are indoctrinating them in order to maximize their own needs.  Why do you think class-based religions like Christianity are always going on about "love"?  It's a way to depoliticize people.  It's a way to enslave them, to make them think that it's not "class-society" that exploits them, but that they are voluntarily self-denying because of "love."  One issue is that this likely will not fit into the feudal/capital marxist paradigm, because as the OP points out, sexual inequality is the root inequality, so, rather, feudalism and capitalism must be recast in terms of a revolutionary sexual politics, which takes equal access to the means of reproduction as the goal of class struggle.  For it's not really sex that matters, but reproduction.  Sex is only pleasurable to ensure reproduction; the issue is not the pleasure of sex, the issue is men being denied access to the means of reproduction.
I disagree completely.  If you take a look at any list of the wealthiest and powerful people in the world, you'll find they all have one thing in common: They own capital.  Because capital, not reproduction, is the motor of modern society. You can't understand the wars in the Middle East without understanding capital. You can't understand automation and outsourcing without understanding capital. You can't understand drug legislation without understanding capital. And, indeed, you can't understand modern institutions of power without understanding capital.  In regard to sexual reproduction, you'll notice that from the rise of agriculture well into the 20th century, women were expected to be housewives. They were expected to perform the bulk of reproductive, domestic labor and they were expected to not be paid for it. In the capitalist context, this was done for many reasons, not the least of which being that it created a massive reserve army of labor. Women were entirely powerless in the early 20th century, viewed as property, or, at best, servants of their husbands. "Gynocracy" is a reality only in the minds of those who are carrying the torch of the women's liberation reaction.  Women's liberation opened the floodgates for competition in the workplaces, depressed labor, and increased unemployment. That's why many workers were (and still are) quite hostile to women who engage in productive labor; they think it undermines them and subjugates them because they don't have a proper class lens to understand this phenomenon. 
Really, people aren't any dumber than they used to be. In fact, if you consider the effects nutrition has on brain development, the average person is, without a doubt, *smarter* than they've ever been in the history of humanity.
This is the difference between theory and reality.  I am old enough to remember when average people were reasonably intelligent.  The average person today is mentally retarded by the standards of when I was younger.  I am not sure of the cause, whether BAD nutrition (trans-fats and other modern poisons) or smartphones causing mental atrophy, or whatever.  But I am absolutely sure that people today are much more stupid than they were when I was younger. 
I just don't think I am buying it.  You're telling me that the most important class distinction is not a product of natural growth, that is, male and female, but a product of, essentially, the institution of a D&amp;D like Roleplaying Game called Capitalism?  Why is it that men struggle to accumulate capital?  It's so that they can reproduce.  Why is it that monkeys don't struggle to accumulate capital?  It's because they are either reproductive-class males or they're not, and no accumulation of capital will change that, tho fighting might.    "And, indeed, you can't understand modern institutions of power without understanding capital."  I would say it is the other way around, and the reason that we lack revolutionary class consciousness today is because there is a declining understanding of sexual politics and the organic differences between males and females.    It's difficult for people 30something or less to understand how many concepts were simply _invented_.  For example, what was called "date rape."  It used to be expected that if you went on a date, the whole purpose was to fool around.  The power was roughly equal---it's not like guys clubbed women over the head in the 50s, put them in the back seat of Daddy's car and drove them to the local makeout spot.  They'd ask "hey, want to go to the sock hop?" or whatever, and this was code-talk for "want to go to the sock hop, then fool around at makeout point?"  Obviously this didn't necessarily mean -sex-, but it at least meant erotica.  The concept of "date rape" was invented so that women would have a power imbalance---now a woman can say "yes, let's go to the sock hop."  The man can buy her dinner beforehand.  She can even enjoy the view for ten minutes at Makeout Point.  But then, as soon as The Duchess decides the evening is over, it is over.  That's not equality, that's a one-sided power, the sort that the nobility enjoyed, of dismissing their servants ad lib.  Rather than treating sex as an organic necessity, it is treated as a legalistic contingency, infused with base legalisms like "consent," which is at most a fiction of contract law, "consensus ad idem."  It's the same thing for other inventions like sexual harassment.  They simply exist to allow women to dominate men, through legalisms.  In a state of nature, there is no alimony, nor is there any authority to force a man to support a child, so there is zero natural transactional cost to a man having sex.  About the only possible cost is that if a man has sex with an inferior woman while he could be having sex with a superior one, his seed falls on a farm with a dry well, as it were.    It's only under the rule of law that men develop costs to having sex with women, which are instituted by the oppressive, legalistic regime of "law and order," for the sole benefit of women.  It's not men who benefit from being required to accumulate capital, to placate women at every turn in order to keep them from divorcing them---it's women who benefit.  The ruling class always presents itself as "keeping the barbarians at the gates from invading" rather than "oppressing the barbarians by denying them an equal share in our polis."
&gt;  small wrists, small frame, skin problems, low height, bad bone structure etc...).  It's curious that the examined life doesn't have time to look far beyond circlejerks on 4chan and the manosphere. And no, cherry picking the science of how many people judge each other at a first glance doesn't count.   Then again, you don't really need to cherry pick any dating app data to lead you to the blackpill, when you're already shallow as Hell, and volcel besides.  I mean, by cast off from the herd, you apparently mean "I have limited social skills." and "My life isn't porn."   You haven't even conquered the cultural programming you absorbed through escapist fiction targeted towards your demographic.   Seriously, Tinder?   I mean, I already knew the motto of this subreddit might as well be "Determined to prove Dunning-Kruger right.", but you're a disappointment even by that low bar.   &gt; Supervillain origin story  Yeah, kids can be cruel to anyone vulnerable. Especially to people who take the teasing personally, and can't keep up the banter. And some adults don't ever grow out of that stage.  Sometimes, there's serious damage inflicted on innocent victims.   You're not one of those innocent victims.   Not anymore. Judging by your recent post history, you've just taken your first steps into becoming a cog in the kyriarchy. 
&gt;  The average person today is mentally retarded by the standards of when I was younger.   Sources: Nostalgia, filtered media vs. people venting online, and reading too much outrage porn about people you disagree with. Also, ignoring Sturgeon's Law.
If you believe Sturgeon's Law, then you should consider all cultures equal since all are 90% crap.  So why don't you just move to Liberia? 
Huh. It's almost like you're unable to consider how the filters for the crap work. Not at all surprising, considering you guys tend to keep the shit and throw away the good stuff.
I see that you are from IncelTears.  That explains your low intelligence. 
You're the one who doesn't understand how functional government works. Or human attraction, beyond a first glance and a snap judgement.   You're demonstrating a failure to think things through, yet here you are on /r/braincels, applauding yourself.   You're so generous, to satirize yourself for me.
You are babbling incoherently, which is to be expected I guess.  You haven't even said anything of substance that can be responded to. 
You made a claim. People today are all retarded compared to your incredibly objective memories of the entire human race.   Please describe what substance you found inside it? You were too busy ranting to say anything thoughtful or intelligent.   Meanwhile, I simply observed that allowing people to vent where billions can see their unfiltered thoughts, will create the impression they are all idiots.   I didn't think I needed to explain it to you, since you already provided the demonstration. 
&gt; It used to be expected that if you went on a date, the whole purpose was to fool around.   Tell me more about what you've learned from the movies. It's educational.
Nothing beats direct experience as a source of information.  My position is based on my direct experience.  However I can provide you with plenty of facts to back up my conclusion, but undoubtedly you will simply reject my facts.  Advances in basic science have ground to a halt.  The advances in basic science in the last century were a historic record.  In this century so far, nothing substance on basic science has been discovered.  In my field which is programming, I see the same result.  While there was some really bad software designed in the last century (Perl and Sendmail), most of it was very well designed.  Almost all software written in this century is crap.  The median income has been declining since 2000.  And finally, IQ:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect#Possible_end_of_progression  Regarding your argument about internet venting, I have also seen a dramatic drop in the intelligence of internet posts since 2000.  The bottom line is that modern culture is complete shit and deserves to be wiped out. 
&gt; I have also seen a dramatic drop in the intelligence of internet posts since 2000.  Confirmed.  And, while part of that might be the Internet becoming "mainstream" and idiots coming online, it still correlates w/ things like the end to increasing IQs---people are getting stupider, this is documented.  The West (and therefore World, because the West is the apex of the World) peaked in the 1950s.  Since then it has been downhill, a race to see how degenerate we can become.  The beginning of the end was coercive "equality" instituted by cases like Brown v. Board of Education and by the US "Civil Rights" acts.  Really, they're "Civil Servitude" acts, because if Alice has a right, it means Bob has a servitude.  "Respect muh rights" means 'serve me.'  The focus for the last 60 years has not been on technological/scientific progress, revealing of greater truth, but on destroying the West via statute and case law designed to integrate degenerates who never could have integrated on a voluntary basis.  Just like how you see stagnation technologically in the USSR, which isn't surprising, because 'equal rights' is basically a statutory form of communism.  There never could have been a violent revolution in USA, theh people are too well armed, so the commies did the next best thing: they de facto nationalized all of the schools and businesses.  Run a school? The Federal Government owns it, g-men will tell you who can attend.  Run a lunch counter?  Same deal, g-men tell you who you must serve sandwiches.  It's just like a communist revolution, except instead of having party members directly manage everything, there is the illusion of free enterprise, but in reality, you have a de facto Federal Government Employee managing all business in the USA.  You're just not going to have progress when the dominant aim of the ruling class is to keep people stupid---the very purpose to 'employment equity' is to redistribute jobs to stupid people who would never obtain them freely.  The very purpose to "gender balance" in University hiring is to do the same thing.  And all of it is rooted in bad continental European philosophy.  It's sad, places like the USA broke away from Europe and its horrible class-system-maintaining philosophies, but not for long: the European cucks got their hooks back in.
&gt; Advances in basic science have ground to a halt.  Right. All that new medicine doesn't count - who cares if people with schizophrenia can manage to lead normal lives so long as they're caught early and don't go off their medication?   It doesn't effect you.  The fact I can hold a movie library, and a library inside a chip the size of my fingernail? Totally worthless. It's small, and we all know how obsessed you are with size.  Then again it's not like you're using the information age to it's fullest potential, so the failure would seem to be yours.  &gt; Almost all software written in this century is crap.  It's how big, compared to the past? Deadlines are how tight? Oh, and let's not forget how addicted men are to short term profits. And before you whine about misandry, we're talking rough heuristics - you can appreciate negative stereotypes any other day.  &gt; The median income has been declining since 2000.  Has everything to do with those who have power becoming smarter at abusing it.   &gt; IQ  You realize there are many forms of intelligence it doesn't measure? Our brains adapt to our environment. Much of what IQ measured is now supplemented artificially, because, for many people, it wasn't needed in a day to day practical sense.   &gt;  I have also seen a dramatic drop in the intelligence of internet posts since 2000.  Straight off a cliff.   That has more to do with immediacy and the lack of the filter we once had. Before, you used to need to want to be here, and seek it out. Some of us had to seriously sacrifice. Now? Everyone's addicted.   But some of it is by design.  There's too much information for most people to filter through, while leading the rest of their lives. Those who filter the information, are very good at dividing up the tribes.   Unfortunately, the conspiracy theorists will make it even easier, since they seem unable to allow for chance or genuine emotion.    Poor communication will do the rest.
One time I taped a buncha firecrackers around a parrot cage cuz he made so much noise all day. I said I'll show you noise you sock cucka!
Also, your understanding of consent suggests a complete lack of empathy - the scientific meaning of understanding other people's subjective experience, not just the "I feel your pain kind."  Though, that too.  And no, "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MAN'S NEED TO BREED!" isn't a rebuttal.   You're simply blind. Or deaf. Or whichever other metaphor you prefer to describe those unable to sense the world around them.   And it's people's right to end your genetic line, if you have nothing to compensate for that handicap.
Consent is a legal fiction, and society is hypocritical about it.  I can totally accept this "consent is 100% required for all touching/interaction" view, the problem is that it renders the rule of law illegitimate.  I mean, we'd never say 'she consented to sex by going into his apartment, and in his apartment, he holds Sway and Imperium!'  But that's the basic premise for social, legalistic coercion, if you're within some geographical area, the state has some legitimate power of coercing you into doing or not doing things.  For example, it can force you to refrain from jaywalking.  If you jaywalk, constable may apply a "braking force" to your body to issue you a ticket.  If you refuse to give him a name, etc. he can arrest you, in many places, for obstruction of justice, take you to jail, take you to court.  So, when did I consent to that?  By voting?  Don't vote.  By existing?  But we can't suggest that 'existence is consent,' because feminist theory of consent says consent is an on-going, active process, and that consent can and amy be withdrawn at any time.  So, constable says "hey you, stop! I am going to give you a ticket," I say "I don't consent to that," and he should leave me alone, and if he doesn't, he is assaulting me, right?  The problem is that if consent is as important as you say it is, everyone who supports the rule of law is basically a psychopath, tho they may lie about being able to be "empathic" in certain situations.  Your basic argument is a 1930s Nazi style argument, except instead of the handicaps they focused on, you're focusing on what you surmise to be cognitive handicaps---it's really creepy, IMO, esp. if you think you're some sort of progressive, not that I necessarily think that you do.  But most "empathic" "women and men" I meet who have a problem with "rape culture" see no contradiction in using compulsory education to 'solve' the problem by coercing little boys into factory-school settings for brainwashing.  So it's never about consent or empathy, it's about control and lies.  Industrial society would be totally impossible of consent were required for every interaction.    What we have is a hypocritical system where women want to have their cake and eat it too.  Consent is paramount and mandatory, except when we're using the state to give men anger management lessons, or using the state to coerce little boys into accepting the feminist doctrine shoved into their eyeballs/ears in compulsory primary education.  "Consent is important when it benefits me, otherwise, not so much."  As in all class societies, the upper class is given an ability to consent or not consent to things, the lower classes are expected to accept coercion.  Also, in a "phil 101" style argument, more pedagogical than not, if it requires consent to apply force to someone, then to charge a rapist with rape would require his consent, because otherwise you are violating his bodily autonomy.  This "he violated someone else's bodily autonomy" is a flimsy rationalization, if violationg bodily autonomy is wrong.  Two wrongs don't make a right.
You realize people have control over what actually enters their bodies? That's their territory, and their rules.  Your amazing hypocrisy on this issue suggests layers of horniness I can't begin to care about. Do you need to go take care of that problem, or something?
Well, OK, so if a guy only rubs up against a woman, that's OK, because he's not entering her?  You're either being purposefully obtuse or you don't understand how state coercion works.  (1) You jaywalk (2) Constable says "stop!" (3) You continue. (4) Constable puts his hand on you.  So, constable has touched you, are you really quibbling that it is different if constable _penetrates_ you?  People have some limited control over what enters their bodies.  If a tree-branch of sufficient mass falls on your head, it is entering your skull, or at least deforming it.  You just want to take these contingent, hypocritical legalisms (violence is wrong---except state enforcement violence, that's OK!) and pretend they're naturalisms.  Legalism is artificial, not natural.  Consent is legal, not natural.  If you like living in a 24/7/365 game of D&amp;D, where you are not equal to the dungeonmaster, I guess that is fine, but many people would prefer to live in a state of nature, where physics is the only law, physical justice the only justice.
&gt; (1) You jaywalk  Nobody's ever said a thing, but okay, abstraction...  &gt; (2) Constable says "stop!"   Although, I'm curious - where do you live, that a cop is going to escalate this situation?   &gt; (3) You continue.   Just like the rapist you are, because "STOP!" means nothing to you, and you ignore traffic signals in all that you do.   &gt; (4) Constable puts his hand on you.  And this is totally like rubbing up against strangers like a cat in heat, why now? You don't process nuance at all, do you?   &gt; So, constable has touched you, are you really quibbling that it is different if constable penetrates you?  Holy fuckballs. Are you real? Now I want to touch you, just to be sure.   WAIT. That's probably what your host body did.   I can see why you're incel. o.o
Or we can go with speeding, etc.  Why should anyone have to obey traffic signals if they don't consent to obeying traffic signals?  Traffic signals are not natural laws, like gravity.  I think you're the one not processing nuance---the issue is that people who say consent matters for sex almost never apply this to its logical end, because they would mean application of law would require consent, because to apply law to someone requires that he be touched.  So it's OK for Constable to touch a man who doesn't consent to municipal laws, not OK for a man to touch a woman who doesn't consent to sex. The hypocrisy is _palpable_ unless you like rationalizin'.  If consent is immaterial, however, as it is in nature, then there is nothing wrong, naturally speaking, with redistributing the means of reproduction by force.  It's simply prohibited in the roleplaying game called "society," which is just another word for "corporation."  So you have a corporatist, contractarian view of how people should relate---it has nothing to do with "empathy."  I mean, to be consistent, we have to say it is wrong in both cases, or acceptable in both cases.  The issue, rationally, comes up when we have some people who get to say "consent is 100% required for any touching" and others whose consent is irrelevant.
It seems r/braincels has had its first heated intellectual debate.  We're really coming along. I'm honestly very proud of the immense progress we've made in laying the groundwork for this sub over the past couple of days.
I don't understand if this account is a bot or not.
I haven't seen it. What was the gist? 
People don’t become dumber around the opposite sex it could even increase intellect.   Pheromones only works with adam’s sweat and even then it only attracts certain people  Small and medium sized breast get around the same tips 0’9 a person.  But big breast get an tip increase of 30% by males and 40% by females  There is no global desired hair color.   And you are seen as more attractive if successful (duh)
I'm...confused.
I think it's ironic. Or at least I hope so.  Citing nothing but fictional characters as examples of "real liberals" is just too stupid for me to believe someone made this sincerely.
Interesting. None of those results strike me as particularly surprising.   Red hair does seem universally unattractive on men, though. I have red hair and I'm very unhappy about it, tbh. I've thought about dyeing it, but that would take too much work.
Ah, I thought you had made it...I was primarily confused by the choice of characters included. Surely a monarch from GoT couldn't be considered "liberal" lol
I just can't do religion. I need freedom to breathe from superstition and ritual, otherwise I'll lose my will to live.
My religion has no superstition.  Rituals are nothing more than exercises.  Do you exercise?  If yes, why are rituals more difficult than physical exercise? 
I think religious rituals are a little bit different because there's an element of compulsion involved; that is, if you want to be a "good adherent" of the religion, you have to repeatedly engage in ritualistic behavior that might not actually improve your life in any significant way.
You'll notice NPR (a mouthpiece for US governmental-military interests) repeats the official, unsubstantiated assertion that the US is in these countries to fight Islamic terrorism. While that is *what* the US is doing there, it's not *why* they're there in the first place.  US-based multinational mega-corporations have a [strong investment base in West Africa](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/07/10/unlocking-investment-in-west-africa) and the US, French, etc. combat forces are all too keen to use the Boko Haram fiasco to get in there and secure that investment climate. Hell, maybe they'll even set up a few puppet states in the process.
The main ritual of the Old Testament is the sabbath.  I think this is a good ritual as I explained here:  http://www.mikraite.org/5-The-Sabbath-tp146.html  It is particularly important if you have a family.  I personally enjoy keeping the sabbath. 
Guess that depends on societal beliefs at the time. Doubt everyone is going to give up on having a job as they'll still be incentive to work (earn more money). In terms of the sexual market and the affect of UBI, I don't see any possible radical changes to what it is now. Women will still go for economically rich males. That being said as men and women reach greater wealth parity then it will be less emphasis on pairing with "breadwinners" but more so on looks, which will be a bad thing for incels.
I haven't seen the play, but I imagine they deified him, so he basically was a fictional character in the image.
here's some poems I wrote  **#1**  Bulging eyes focused on the man  while his pair of eyes stared right back  The Crowd hungered for the last act;  one last trick before parting ways  Glad to oblige, he grabbed the saw,  splitting his torso from his legs  **#2**  The planes dropped quick death from the skies  And left only corpses around,  whose flesh was inspected by flies  When they were not yet in the ground  **#3 (this one's about Nechayev)**   His focus never shifted  as his cold eyes tore apart Mankind  His spirits never lifted  until the world was redefined  No Pope could make him cower  No Cop could make him confess  He would tear their grip from power  and he would not stop for any less
Why do you take them? 
I tried to kill myself and was prescribed them. I don't want to upset my family, so I still take them even though I'm skeptical of their effect.
From what little I know, it seems that anti-depressants turn you into a zombie.  So if suicide is what you want, then anti-depressants are effectively a long slow lifelong suicide that avoids upsetting other people.  But if you decide that you want to live, then this isn't the right approach. 
I might stop taking them once I transfer to a university. That's only a year from now and then my family wouldn't know, so I wouldn't have to worry about them getting on my case.
Why not cut back the dosage with a pill cutter?
who cares about a bunch of Chaditos. Let 'em all burn, they'd all mog me
**Short story:**  With my fiancee behind me, I started walking towards the announcer that called my name... for the Nobel Prize in Physiology for the year 2022, for finding the world's first cure for autism.  "Wait, how on earth did I get so far?" I thought to myself.  I reflected back to my childhood, when I was diagnosed autistic and was in special education, where many adults told me that most people in STEM fields were socially deficient, and I would grow up to be like them, maybe even better.  When I was 15, I had discovered a movement called the "neurodiversity" movement.  Many members of this movement claimed that autism was a "difference", not a disability, and that autistics were responsible for all the major inventions.  Because I had some savantlike ability in math, I majored in engineering in college.  However, my grades started falling, and as a result, I started reevaluating my beliefs, finding other Autism researchers that were doubtful of those stereotypes.  To make things worse, I learned that a researcher that thought that Einstein had "signs" of Autism only made that claim because [“This condition can make people depressed or suicidal, so if we can find out how to make things easier for them, that’s worthwhile.”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3676-einstein-and-newton-showed-signs-of-autism/), stating that he *only* wanted Autistic people to feel better.  On top of it all, many studies showed that autistics had an 80% unemployment rate.  I felt highly betrayed.  I would try to talk about my desire for a cure online, and even promote it on Wikipedia and WebMD.  People kept trying to censor my opinions, which just gave me more motivation.  I also decided to search for a cure.  After learning about a study that claimed some autistics might have different facial features, I went to a plastic surgeon and *only* told him that I felt too much pressure on my forehead.  He said my forehead muscle was working too hard, and prescribed me four shots of botox over a year.  I would later incorporate this into my formal research (http://archive.is/F1Yw6).  Over time, my job performance rapidly increased, and everyone noticed this.  I then decided that forehead contouring surgery would be the best treatment for myself.  The objective would be to smooth the muscles in my forehead by smoothing the bone underneath, causing the muscles to contour and release muscle tension.  Overall, I had discovered greater scientific knowledge.  I also could:  * walk straighter  * take care of myself  * easily converse with others  * work productively  * think more abstractly  ...along with many other benefits.  Through my scientific achievements, I was on the road to overcoming incel.  
Very good thread.  I've noticed this trend as well. It's kind of like autistic people are only represented as extremes; either the nonverbal screechers, or the scientific savants.
I like this a lot. Has kind of a David Foster Wallace fictional essay sort of vibe.
Poem:  Just kill me and stuff me under ground  The silence will be a relief  And the dirt will keep me company  Just kill me and don't think of me again
Of course.  No sensible person would bother trying to communicate with members of modern culture. 
This is one of the more unique perspectives I've read in regard to the Iliad. 
The Odyssey just continues the same theme of not messing with another man's woman.  But it does this in contrast to the Iliad using an example of good.  The good wife remains faithful to her husband.  The good husband does whatever it takes to return to his faithful wife.  And the degenerate chads who chase the faithful wife deserve to be slaughtered, which is the happy ending of this story. 
Why classify cockroaches?  I have no interest in subsets of modern culture.  I am interested in alternatives to modern culture. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieimw3a6Sow
I don't think that members of modern culture can intentionally lie since they can't distinguish between what is true and false. 
Why do you think so?
Because they lack both knowledge and intelligence, so they have no way of finding truth.  The things they say are obviously insane to anyone with common sense. 
But it works for normies. And the world is mostly run by normies right?
Only in the short term.  Members of modern culture are living on the fruits of the past produced when their culture was still good.  But modern culture is declining in every way.  I doubt it will last another 100 years, and during the decline members of modern culture will suffer a lot. 
What do you hate about modern culture? Do you prefer old Greek culture?
Every culture goes through the same basic cycle.  I hate all degenerating cultures in history.  I agree with Aristophanes's criticism of degenerating liberal Athens.  I hate what Greece became when it fully degenerated and fell, like the Stoic Zeno.  I love pre-socratic Athens and I love pre- Civil War America. 
So the nuclear family?  Did you know according to old myths females were the pursuers. 
Nuclear family is fine, but extended family integrated into a good culture is even better.  I don't know which myths you are referring to, and what these women pursued (husband or sex).  Anyway, as Ecclesiastes says, there is nothing new under the sun.  Culture have been rising and falling forever, and when they degenerate, their women generally become vulgar sluts. 
I like to always be constantly talking to people I disagree with. It sharpens my wit and keeps me from being caught off guard when I encounter someone who thinks differently than myself.
Normies lie constantly and almost always for egocentric, self-interested reasons.
I also like talking to people with other viewpoints.  But modern culture is the worst choice since its members are universally stupid, ignorant, and intolerant, and so are incapable of conversation.  Judaism is also bad because of intolerance and dishonesty, but at least they aren't stupid and ignorant.  I enjoy talking to Muslims and traditional Mennonites in the West, and Buddhists in the East and Shinto followers in Japan. 
Nothing but a karma whoring sub. They take everything way too seriously.
If your not a Cerebrotonic you need to leave this sub
Sometimes I write on shabbat.  Here is today's output:  http://www.mikraite.org/A-Muslim-Tale-expanded-tp1612.html 
If any of those honestly run, we are truly forsaken.
lol, I'm a mixture of Cerebrotonic and the Mouse.
Zuckerberg would be a moron to run, tbh.  He has much more power as the billionaire CEO of a technology that almost all of the advanced world uses than he could *ever* have as President.
It regularly goes private when the sub gets raided by a much bigger sub.  Don't worry, it'll come back in no time.
Interesting update/expansion. I thought it was entertaining.  If you don't mind me asking, what is your religious affiliation? I've seen you make several references to both Islam and Orthodox Judaism.

who are the getting brigaded by this time?
I'm not sure. I don't browse there as often because I feel it's become a stale, mostly unoriginal parody of itself.
Good point. I definitely think he could win if he ran. Americans have an eternal hard-on for "sensible businessmen".
I follow the Old Testament.  I like Islam and hate Talmudic Judaism.  I attend my local mosque twice each week - Jumah (main friday service) and Saturday night.  The boat story was mentioned in the last 2 jumah talks, which is what inspired me to write this. 
Oh, okay.  What's your opinion on the Shia-Sunni conflict? It seems like such brutal sectarian violence over such a minor disagreement.
I don't care, I am not interested.  This is an internal Muslim issue and I am not Muslim, so it is none of my business.  My primary goal is to find a reasonable path through life for moral intelligent people.  And I think I have finally found that path which is following the Old Testament in the context of a Muslim community.  So my interest is in developing this idea and making sure that it really works.  Getting involved in internal Muslim issues is bad for this idea. 
the quityourbullshit subreddit, some cel posted there and the hive swarmed the mothership.
I wish I could submit an OpenSSL or GPG public key to /u/azavii so my use of accounts like toilet paper doesn't lock me out. I'd just have to submit a signed request for approval from my new names and he could see that I am me.
Productivity is anathema for a true incel.
Unfortunately this seems true.  What would make sense would be to be productive in things that benefit you, and avoid being productive in anything that benefits modern society.

Red hair is very appealing, though. My first bf had the whole red hair, pale skin and freckles thing going on and I thought it was beautiful. I mean, there is a reason that Tormund guy off GoT is so popular with female fans.   Feel free to call me a filthy cock-gagging whore now or whatever, just wanted to let you know that is likely not true and it would be a shame to dye it. 
That's a long-winded way of saying "they disagree with my bullshit".
Well, that's kind of reassuring. Thanks for the input!
It would be pretty cool to colonize west africa.  
It went private, thank god. The cancer is contained. 
No, it is a subreddit that shows off the side of Incelism that is humorously terrible.
I am addressing this to members of this sub who are unlikely to agree that any side of Incelism that is humorously terrible.  Of course members of modern culture should post to IncelTears, not here.  But I don't consider members of modern culture to be sane. 
Soothing
I thought so too. The Burzum riff gives it a nice anchor for melody and rhythm while the various synth noises/sound effects/distortions create a really aggressive but strangely pleasant atmosphere.   I don't care what anyone says, Merzbow is a genius.
It's called a fairy tale for a reason.
You're very welcome. Glad I could help a little.

I'm not passive, not apathetic.  I have no problem with life tasks.  I can even deal with members of modern culture by faking it, no matter how much I hate them.  I have fixed most problems in my life (being single, being poor, etc.).  Do I need leave this sub? 
Thanks for sharing!  I was always a lurker on Incels, and now I’m locked out... any other subs where we can be ourselves without getting trolled by a bunch of beta chad wannabes?

Great, I haven’t looked at that one yet, I’ll check it out!  I’m glad that I stumbled on this one - really nice to not lose touch with the community entirely.... I was having withdrawal lol
Yes
Ye just got banned there.
You can come to my sub too, /r/IncelHelp.
Censorship is almost impossible to escape on Reddit.  That's why I really want this sub to be as free from it as possible and I promise to only delete posts that violate US law or Reddit's content policy for the foreseeable future.
Hope you stick around!  We're quite small at the moment, but we are rapidly growing (due in no small part to some users helping me out, especially fschmidt) and I  think we have a chance of becoming a really great, unique place for incels to be creative, intellectual, and entertaining.
Or try to avoid the disgustingly toxic subs and try to make your life more positive. 
It's not toxic if it's truth.  My life is plenty positive, I just have one piece of it that's missing to be really satisfying.  I enjoy the discussion of the community, it's comforting to know I'm not the only one in this boat.
I think I will - I tend to lurk a lot, so I may not be super active, but I'll be here reading anyway!
Regardless of whether or not you think this event was a good thing, it is undeniable that it changed the entire historical landscape of the 20th century and beyond.
So who would you support - the Mensheviks, the Socialist Revolutionaries, Trotsky, or Lenin? 
Trotsky and Lenin were actually on the same side. Stalinists lie and try to pretend that they weren't, but Stalinists lie in regard to just about everything.  And I would have supported the Bolsheviks. The Mensheviks were liberals and the SRs had no coherent unifying ideology other than a base of support among the peasantry.
&gt; Trotsky and Lenin were actually on the same side.  You are right.  I thought the split was earlier, but I guess it was Stalin purging the competition.  &gt; And I would have supported the Bolsheviks. The ... SRs had no coherent unifying ideology other than a base of support among the peasantry.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Revolutionary_Party  This sounds a lot better to me than the Bolsheviks.  This sounds like it would have taken Russia in the direction that it is now, just a lot faster. 
**Socialist Revolutionary Party**  The Socialist Revolutionary Party, or Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (the SRs; Russian: Партия социалистов-революционеров (ПСР), эсеры, esery) was a major political party in early 20th century Russia and a key player in the Russian Revolution. Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms. After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government. In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Braincels/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

I see where you're coming from, but I think the main flaw with the Socialist Revolutionaries is that they lacked any real theoreticians. They were basically populists, which is fine to a point, but it gets messy in complex situations like the overthrow of Tsarism.
Think again cuckboi.
[removed]
Lol
Is gone
Can you edit your first sentence? I think it violates Reddit's content policy (particularly the threats of violence/physical harm part).  Otherwise I'll have to delete your thread, which I don't want to do.
[removed]
Its almost like incels are a bunch of weak virgin faggots calling for violence against others on the daily.
I'm not gonna ban you, but for the love of God, higher quality posts please.
Are you sure? I thought it just went private. 
I can't access it so idk
Screw off, your the type of person that got incels removed
I apologize sir. I'm a bit new here, unaware of the higher standard's. Looking for a new home rn.
We are using Reddit's platform. If we want to avoid being kicked off said platform, then we have to abide by Reddit's policies.  It isn't voluntary. Though, personally, I think violent posts contribute nothing to the discussion and I have no displeasure in deleting them.
Man this is bad... cucktears are saying multiple back ups are shut down but I'm not sure either.
It's quite alright. We always welcome new members. I try to have a hands-off moderation style when possible, but some things aren't really optional.
It looks like this one is still up but private so maybe it still exists
Stop being a bigoted homophobe
but it's part of a discussion, it's wrong to silence people simply because you don't agree with them, I wouldn't even call myself an incels. Sure some are posting "violent" posts and such but that's just what you have to deal with, it's not like this people are actually serious anyway.
It's a fine line. I'm very lax, but if the rules say someone can't post something violent, then I'll enforce those rules if I have to.  I don't want this sub to get deleted. If a few people get pissed that I removed their posts, that's a price I'm more than willing to pay.
I see that, goodluck
Good.  This one will get nuked soon too :)
Except this sub fits all of reddit's requirements, unlike that doxxing hate subreddit you come from
It's almost like all cucktears can think about is incels, it's almost like they're obsessed with us
[removed]
Except for the fact that this sub is blatant ban evasion and will likely be banned soon, just like the others ones are getting banned.
there is now a /incel/ on 8chan that is where we can seek refuge. https://8ch.net/incel/index.html
How is it ban evasion if it existed before incels got banned?
/r/incels has been banned. 
Ok. Nothing screams success like the inability to get laid and complaining about it on the Internet. Why are you even still here? Your community is unhealthy as fuck. Stop blaming women on your own lack of motivation and success.
High quality != more words
Because normies are painfully incapable of reason.
I deserve a more creative response. Please try harder, daddypanties.
Fuck off nomaloid
Because it's now being used as a new /r/incels subreddit lol.
r/IncelDiscussions is another posting such classics articles as science and rape 
Im sorry daddy reddit took away your playroom.
Stop belittling half the human race and calling for violence.
&gt;I deserve a more creative response  Not with unsubstantiated accusations, you don't.
Yeah, Elliot Rodgers was just goofin around.
Get help
Stop making fun of me for being ugly and a virgin. Tell half the population to stop shaming me for the fact that I'm a virgin
Pretty sure all your subs getting deleted that call for violence and hatred everyday is enough evidence for healthy people to cast judgement. You know you're a cuck, but don't act like a victim for all the nasty shit you guys post. Be a man. Own it.
Of course it's "daddy reddit", do you also call your wifes bull Daddy?
That's not something I have under my control. People go where they go.
don't think he posted on incels, also that was. Literally like seven years ago.
&gt; Get help  People "fighting" anonymous Internet virgins need help.
Shaming men for not being manly enough?
Reminder women think 80% of men are inferior.
yup its over   Fuck spez
Literally no one is shaming you. No one cares. There are ugly people on dating sites and Craigslist. If you care that much about sex you can easily find someone to fuck tonight.
Literally 3 years ago.
I like how one virgin kills people and you paint us all in a bad light. Meanwhile most killers are *not* virgins. Nice confirmation bias. Using your fucked up mentality, why don't you go after non-virgins instead since more of them are criminals?
Except no, I have been shamed for being a virgin. And guess what, I want physical human contact, not some whore from Craigslist
The dude was proposing that he should rape women like he was a refugee because his sub got shut down. The fact that you're defending him is beyond reproach. Its not about being a man, It's about not being a piece of shit to women and improving your life.
Go find a woman who doesnt think like that. Also, check your own value. Do you deserve a girlfriend? Are you any fun? Why would someone date you? Im not trying to be mean, i really want you to think what you offer and if you should even have a girl in your life until you become a more interesting person and can handle a relationship.
Nobody cares that you're a virgin, people are responding because you guys act like sexually entitled pieces of garbage. Nobody owes you sex. No body cares that you don't have sex. If its so important to you you could find someone to suck your little ding dong tonight on some dating site.  Stop blaming the world for you being an asshole.
It needs to be low key for now
But incels think all women over the age of 9 are whores. I'm afraid that's a disgusting and dangerous mentality to have. Don't worry, there's plenty of physical contact to be had in prison.
It's true though, like this [one](https://www.google.com/amp/nypost.com/2017/11/07/tip-stealing-uber-passenger-identified-as-brooklyn-teen/amp/) for example.   Also, what do you expect me to go to prison for? Are you gonna call the fbi on me for disrespecting women?
Why do you even want a woman if you think they're all fucking whores? There's plenty of unsucked dick for you to wrap your cuck mouth on.
The thing is, most of what r/Incels say isn't truthful. They believe it is, but the majority are mentally ill.  
Agreed, this was a long time coming.  r/incels lost all of its quality and purpose because some people wanted to spend all day complaining about vaginas. I do not mourn its loss in the slightest.
Only a matter of time before you're gone as well unfortunately, in the space of a few hours they've removed loads of us. R.I.P incels
It would be incredibly unfair if they do decide to delete us. We haven't broken any site rules, especially not any that relate to violence/promoting violence.
To fill in the story, I think Crusader70 is an alias for Caamib who basically founded /r/incels after /r/truecels was banned.  After /r/incels was overrun with morons, he started /r/IncelDiscussions and then he was banned.  There are some lessons to be learned.  Modern Western culture is basically Stalinism with no free speech.  All of Reddit's rules are lies because everything said by a Stalinist is a lie.  Reddit will simply ban whoever it wants to without regard for its own rules.  The best way to avoid being banned is to remain below the radar.  In other words, don't allow posts that excite politically correct morons.  Anything that requires any degree of intelligence to understand is safe because these Stalinists are quite stupid. 
I agree with your analysis wholeheartedly. Western culture is a plague on this world that stifles free thought and Reddit is merely another manifestation of this wider plague.
People screeching and ree'ing about *"da feeeeemales"* online need to get help a hell of a lot more lmao
Still, he wasn't on incels
I agree. But i wish someone would make a good voat subverse. 
recruit people, we need more people like you comrade
Voat has this: https://voat.co/v/Incels  Unfortunately Voat isn't so good and lacks search, so it is no better than creating a stand-alone forum. 
This sub seems well moderated.  If this sub gets banned, then I would say that it is time to give up on reddit. 
Im on it. I've been looking through old incel subs seeing who's still around.
well, either incelswithouthate got banned or i got banned from there in warning from supportcel.  dropping like flies, the cel subs are
direct message me 
don't ever give up my fellow comrade
yeah i just got banned too. i wanted to tell fellow cels not to go to supportcel and they kicked me out.  for you cels reading this, supportcel is modded by inceltears members - do not go to supportcel and apparently incelswithouthate, both those subs suppress free speech.  see this post that the mods hid to censor my free speech: r/SupportCel/comments/7b1cou/xpost_from_rincelswithouthate_women_nonincels/
Giving up on reddit doesn't mean giving up.  There are other options. 
Nah, if this subreddit gets deleted, I think I'm done with this whole site.  I've completely obeyed the content policy. It would be fundamentally unjust.
that's understandable, I don't believe in giving up, even if its rigged against us, we can't quit.

Free speech does not mean freedom from consequences.  Furthermore the "right to free speech" prevents the government from silencing dissenters.  Reddit, while open to the public, is a private entity and has the right to set and enforce standards as they see fit.
Self-censorship is just part of the reality of living under modern Stalinism.  Just like under the Soviets, one can voice opinions if one does it carefully so as not to upset the tyrants in power.  There is no other option on reddit.  Anything else will fail.  Outside of the reddit, there are some options.  I will post about these when I have time. 
i like the name of the revolution.
I recommend 8chan or oniichan (Tor).

I hope we can keep this momentum going.  I think we're all in agreement that this sub should have all of the good things about r/incels (critique of modern society and oppression, stimulating discussions, shared emotional experiences, and creative works) without any of the bad things (rampant stupidity, stale memes, echo chamber, juvenile rants about vaginas, etc.)  If we stick to that vision, I think we could easily become a *very* popular sub in a relatively short time frame. I have extremely high hopes for this community.
Our sub seems to have stayed somewhat under the radar for  now, from both migrators and those who hunt and oppress them in the name of sexual capitalism.  I hope it stays this why. We can't handle everyone coming over at once, it would be better if people come over slowly.
Agreed.  People have been spamming downvotes and also spamming reports (just about every high-profile thread has been reported by some upset normie at least once.)
I like this place. It has a very soothing atmosphere.
Nowhere else to go but up
I agree. We should build up steadily but not too rapidly. If, like, 500 people came here at once, I wouldn't be able to contain all the shitposts and we would become Normie Central.
Welcome, friend!  I really want to foster a friendly, even familial tone in this community, so I'm very happy to hear you say that.
I would disagree. A comment in the linked thread says:  &gt;Maybe it just transcended past the need for much discussion.  And it did. All it was was a support (i.e. venting) sub and a blackpill factory. It produced venting stories and blackpill memes like an assembly line of [life/sui] fuel and poignant memes.  What else would it have done? The key element of the blackpill is LDAR, and everyone on the sub was already blackpilled. Should we just reteach *ourselves* the blackpill? Or somehow synthesize new topics out of LDAR, a reality which is explicitly...well, LDAR? It's not after all a height of innovation of discovery.  I think the people most worried about the behavior of the incels sub were not fully blackpilled themselves.
By chance, do you have more details of why the sub was banned? Reddit consensus says that subs are only banned when they make reddit look bad in mass media; was incels featured somewhere or otherwise became well known?  I found it...sad to believe the alternative, that hateful normie false reporting alone did this.
To me, the blackpill is not to LDAR. I view LDAR as an understandable *symptom* of the blackpill, but the real blackpill is that modern society is fundamentally corrupt, immoral, and, most importantly of all, *dying*.  Most incels hated women, which was never the point. The point was to hate society as we know it and to yearn for its fall and replacement with a better, more civilized society. Most incels never had such a revelation, so I do not think they were properly blackpilled.
I've heard rumors that it had something to do with an incel planning to rape someone, but I haven't been able to verify that.
I don't know exactly why the sub was banned, but here is some mass media coverage.  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reddit-and-violent-speech-can-hate-be-banned_us_5a008815e4b0d467d4c226e4 
We need to regroup, and keep a low profile. I'm not sure up-voting would do us any good, given that they have already shut the new incel subreddits that were gaining traction.

Up-voting serves 2 purposes.  First, if someone has a low karma then they have to wait several minutes between posting.  I know because I have a low karma almost everywhere.  We don't want this to happen to our users.  And second, low point scores just hurt people's egos and there is no need for that.  I don't think point scores will affect our profile, so I wouldn't worry about that. 
I see it as the other way around. The blackpill itself is just lookism, the intuitive reality that looks matter. The problems with modern western society lie in how it deals - or fails to - with this reality, leaving an underclass of men and presumably women who are condemned by no fault of merit. So the problems with society are *that symptom* of the blackpill, not the blackpill itself.  Now, we could say if the social issues are the conclusion of the blackpill regarding society, than LDAR is the conclusion of the blackpill on the individual level. Since that's what incels was really about, a support sub for incels, to me blackpill is almost synonymous with LDAR because it is almost always references in the context of the individual.  On a side note, [I just made this thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/7bjn5t/how_normies_ldar_an_analysis_of_coping_among/) which I've been thinking of doing for a while. I'd appreciate if you could take a look :)
From a purely business perspective, it actually makes sense to ban all controversial subs.  Advertisers don't want to be associated with controversy.  So this isn't going to work. 
There are 2 points here.  On the first point, I disagree with you and reject lookism.  On the second point, I agree with you and reject the blue(balls)pill.  Lookism is a recent incel meme.  This idea didn't exist among earlier (more intelligent) incels.  Obviously looks matter, but so do many other factors.  Unless you are very ugly, I doubt that looks is the dominant cause of your incel.  If you want to create a separate thread to debate lookism, I can go into more detail. 
&gt;Obviously looks matter, but so do many other factors. Unless you are very ugly  That's exactly one of the examples. That "unless you are very ugly" is the 3-5% of the population who are trucels. That's Lookism.
What if the controversy bleeds all over because there is no containment board? Reddit wants you and I to give up and leave, our response should be to get comfy in /r/sex, /r/relationships, /r/deadbedrooms, and various therapy subs, etc, and start making it all fucking dark and 'unsafespace' like. Our response at some point needs to be to fight. We are already pariahs, what do you have left to lose but boredom and loneliness?  Fuck me, is there any gamer/incel overlap? The desire to beat a boss?
/r/supportcel isn't terrible and it's modded by more sympathetic /r/inceltears members and several reformed incels.
Right, passive nihilism vs active nihilism. I wonder how square Nechayev with such bourgeois morality and a hope for a better society. Nechayev was all about absolute, unconditional destruction. He writes that we are doomed, and the ideology of replacement/improvement is part of the problem. It's right there in the 23 thesis of The Revolutionary Catechism. Our concern is not that of building the future, but of destroying the present. 
&gt; And the world is mostly run by normies right  Not really, it's run by people who are privy to the game and manipualte it.

Members of this/that sub may be unlikely to agree, but to everyone else you guys are so pathetic that it's actually pretty hilarious. The only time it's not funny is when the posts get into "probably a rapist" territory. 
Most incels that I knew were not that ugly, and all who tried were able to find girlfriends abroad.  It's actually quite hard for men to judge other men's looks, but I can just ask my wife. 
Lol 😂
From their perspective, this is basically a spam problem, and I am sure they can deal with spam.  I'm not a gamer.  The game I play is business, and I enjoy beating the system at that. 
It looks like we are losing on this.  I am a programmer and I can probably hack the CSS to remove voting.  Let me know if you want me to do this. 
and yet here you are

are you guys joking or 
“Modern Stalinism” ho boy, classical stalinism was not for you. 
I definitely agree with her. Red hair gives off an almost mythical vibe.
bullshit, they restrict free speech... see this post the mods hid from their sub as an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportCel/comments/7b1cou/xpost_from_rincelswithouthate_women_nonincels/  i dont trust people who cant even put up reasoned arguments to civil discourse.  cels dont listen to this liar.
What is the point of making these new subreddits? Do you enjoy being censored? r/incels formation made sense when reddit's moderation was more lax but now there is just no point.  Anyway, that subreddit went to shit. Intelligent discussion should take priority over silly memes. I don't know about any of you, but I'm not in the mood for humour very often throughout my miserable days.   One thing is for sure: the children making light of our insufferable existence (that is, the normies who spam memes all day) need to be segregated from the more intellectual among us. Call it sanctimonious, but it is vital.
Yes agreeing with shit people have to search for to find how dare they. 
a suggestion: why dont you watch these videos and refute them as part of your response.  i’m not challenging you, im trying to open a debate amongst cels about this.   note: i dont agree with everything in the videos but 85% of whats being said is correct.  https://youtu.be/EFnJMPQow7A  https://youtu.be/kVB3ypWVu14  https://youtu.be/N0m_GVG3Oxo  https://youtu.be/6aq0eGdHMkA  u/LMSandFACE can provide more commentary if you wish refute these videos.
Isn’t downvotes supposed to show the fact it fits the post. 
COPE
what's wrong with the people on the right? they look happy.
And how do you think you look?
WHERE DO WE GO NOW 
Sounds like you're just incapable of reading a room and want to blame it on everyone but yourself.
you would be surprised to learn that even tho the left claims catalan for their own, their leaders are center right, as such i support them and wish to have 500 countries instead of 200.  The reason is quite simple, the more countries there are, the harder fot the globalists to control all of us.  imagine the globalists fighting 300 mini-vietnams at any one given time.
OMG YOU'RE RIGHT I'M SO UGLY, BOOHOOHOO  .....but I do get laid.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
&gt;The only time it's not funny is when the posts get into "probably a rapist" territory.  Which is disturbingly often.  I feel bad for the Incels folks, because all of them seem completely blind to how much everyone else hates them.
This appeals to my active sex life and intellect and Chadliness and is truly a reflection of how often I get laid.  Jesus christ you guys, my god. You act like you're persecuted. The only problems you actually have are social anxiety problems, and if you tried getting over those (instead of feeding them by being here), you might have a nice life before you die instead of fucking wasting it.
TO A NON KANE-SIRE* SUB MAYBE GEE I DUNNO  *edit for spelling I used the wrong cancer sorry guise, gotta re-educate myself at /r/incels   Shit wait 
It's spelled cancerous
no u
And here you have your average normie ladies and gents. /u/azavii... Oh shit wait
No u
Would appreciate.
I said they're sympathetic, I didn't say they agreed with incels. 
Nah, just the lunatics that populated some of the incel subs. The rest of you sexless bastards are alright, albeit depressing.
Top row, second from the left is a chick.  Just saying...
Why is there a roastie fighting with us?
Stop blaming others get off the fucking internet and learn social skill it's not that fucking difficult. Or get a job save money and hire a hooker
They can deal with automated spam. They cannot deal with new user accounts which normalfag to comment karma 50 or something before 'deploying.'
... dude. People killed themselves because of that sub. Reconsider. 
Since someone from this very thread referenced you all as a place where incels can engage in civil discourse, let’s see if you all ban me for disagreeing.  First - some of what you say is valid. But it’s nit just normies looking to suppress your right to talk about “lookism.” I think for the most part, the whole “looksmatch” argument is correct. I’ve always been surprised when I look at the partners of many of my friends da and realize that, After BOTH genders dated a lot, they wound up getting into long term relationships with people who were generally on the same attractiveness level as them. But as much as some incels on these threads want to ignore the idea that personality plays a factor, there are other elements at play besides appearance when it comes to relationships.  Second - with regard to not acknowledging the plight of incels, my main issue is with the particular individuals who promote violence, rape, pretend rape doesn’t exist, and presume to know everything about women because AWALT. As much as some incels cannot stand it when women bring in their own personal experience, I’m just going to put it out there that my own life experience completely counters most of the incel assumptions about what women over 35 are.  Having a strong distaste for the people who post openly hateful things about women, I also have sympathy for a lot of you guys. (Sympathy however does not entitle you to sex). I have actually had a few friends who would probably have said they were incels at one point or another. And not being able to find a relationship is hard. They dealt with it by seeking out friends, one of them got therapy, the other one threw them self into graduate work. And now they are all married with kids. That’s not a majical exquation, but it’s just what happened.   Third - some people think sex matters, some don’t. I agree that just saying sex shouldn’t matter isn’t a solution to your problem, but the overwhelming issue I have is that some incels post that they believe they are entitled to sex from women. They are entitled to it more than “chad.” I have a lot of trouble with people negating my own agency in choosing a partner, and I have a lot of trouble with an entitlement statement that quite frankly comes across a little rapey. I am not saying you have personally made this statement here... I’m giving you a broad example of the kinds of posts I have seen.
If they CHANGED THEIR SHITTY CREEPY ABUSIVE personality people would like them better. But they’re not the ones that need changing 🙄

At least the guys on the right have each other...   You?   Your hand is probably sick and tired of you by now  
Wait seriously?? I'm out if the loop.
I mean... Worshipping school shooters seems like an alright reason to ban people, right? Because 5 minutes on that sub shows you enough of that
Yeah and your group of ugly males posted on r/legaladvice and was trying to rape a girl. Not dangerous right? 
You'll be okay. But you need to change way you look at the world from all the incel posting. It's not about you needing hobbies, it's about how angry you are at the world. You can hide behind the women are evil and the world is against me incel mindset to stop yourself feeling like it's about you, but put the shield down. Give people a chance.  Believe me I've felt that crippling anger when it felt like the world was out to get me, I wanted revenge on the people who hurt me, all the friends who made me feel pointless and used-I went genuinely insane.(ps I'm considered an 'attractive girl' by a lot of people, I get those feelings too. ) I only made friends again when I let go of those people and focused on positive things about me. 
Suicides, attempted rapes and self harm are encouraged and plastered all over the incel subs. Multiple people have encouraged people to kill themselves and some have follow through.  
I like how Elliot looks like he’s trying to pick up a dude. 
I am trying hard since I was born, I was bullied almost till death. It is illegal in my country to hire hooker.
lol
link it dawg
&gt; learn social skill  Okay. Then what do I do about my lack of defined jawline, non-protruding chin, sub 6'4 height?
There are 13 year olds that have done **ANAL** while many Incels have never even held a female human of breeding age's hand at age 35+. Do not insult us.
No.
So why bad /r/incels and not /r/legaladvice?
There is no point to speak with them, they will repeat the same bs till death
You guys really love ignoring the facts
The fact is that I made this subreddit 18 days ago and it has absolutely nothing to do with the deletion of another subreddit.
Why don’t you guys put half as much work in to not being an incel as you do defending it?
I got banned from /r/incels for trying to post positive things to people exhibiting suicidal thoughts.      common post titles of that sub were "suicide fuel". Acting like that sub did anything other than propagate suicidal tendencies and almost praise it is ridiculous. I saw *several* comments in posts about someone saying they were going to commit suicide with "sorry you can't cope anymore, take out a roastie with you if you can".      
https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/7aexu8/incel_is_super_concerned_about_catching_rapists/?st=J9R89YBV&amp;sh=bd37f554https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/7aexu8/incel_is_super_concerned_about_catching_rapists/?st=J9R89YBV&amp;sh=bd37f554
Probably because sane people don't like calls for rape and murder of women by you people
Literally most posts on incels were "probably a rapist" territory. Nothing about it is funny or a joke. "Incel culture" is toxic and dangerous, as it radicalizes young men who believe that there is no hope for them. It normalizes rape behaviors, and makes them believe all of the awful things they say about women.
LOL BYEEEEEEEEEE. Good Riddance
there are also shortcels like me there. thats usually an argument of face vs height.
[removed]
Well, /r/legaladvice actually serves a purpose.
Or just use your big brains and lots of free time and set up your own site for your bullshit.  Of course if you guys could think like that instead of just being whiny entitled trolls, you'd be normies...
we always have r/2meirl4meirl for the praising of suicide 👌👌👌💯
I'm a mix between a wageslave and a cerebrotonic. 
So you admit that you knew objectionable content would show up eventually?
You must have done a shit job at trying to be positive if they banned you for it. 
Excuse me kind sir, but your second point proves to me the AFBB concept. Sadly, we as incels along with normies are the beta bucks of society. So either I'm a resource slave to a woman or will be forever an incel. I choose the latter. 
Wait... Plural? I saw a bit of ER worship during my time on the subreddit but nobody else was glorified other than St. BlackOps2cel
Oh, is that how it works?
You should get some help.
The internet is very important to me.  I want my own safe space, so to speak.
You sound like an edgy 12 year old.
Nope, Elliot Rodgers as well. Heck, they even encouraged others to 'take as many as they can' if they would commit suicide. The only reason they didn't do it themselves was because 'they weren't brave enough'... Been on the sub a few times, seen enough of that to know how f***ed up it is.  Edit: nvm read that wrong 🙄 nothing to see here
This post is a perfect example of why you guys need therapy not a forum to discuss rape and suicide. Who the hell speaks about women like that?
[removed]
Nah, that's too easy and frankly **boring**.
[removed]
Where do you think ugly celibate men went?  Vaporized?
Hahahahaha your new sub was nuked too. BYEEEEEEEEEEEE
 ER stands for Elliot Rodger 😂
False
Jesus, shut the fuck up. This is just a meme posted by a mod 13 days ago, its not that deep. You don't know what problems anyone in incels has, stop generalizing anxiety disorders you fucking idiot. I think you're a bigger faggot for those ASMR posts.   Edit: Holy fuck, you really have just sat in incel subs all day trying to insult people hahahaha
You can't really blame a lonely man's suicide on a subreddit.
If I could I wouldn’t be here would I? Why are you here?
nope.      there was a guy, name was close to foreigncel if memory serves. He took issue with me being there after there was a post I saw a question I had an answer for. Sparked a short conversation in which all my comments were well received/upvoted. Foreigncel took issue with it however because in that comment I mentioned that I was below average in looks, not physical fit and have had sex and was in a long lasting relationship (again, the person I was talking to and I were having a conversation in which all my comments had upvotes, no one was responding negatively to it).      The same guy started saying that "I'm the reason incels kill themselves". I took offense to that since I had done nothing in the sub other than answer questions and engage in conversation with someone. I can't remember the conversation directly anymore as it was several months ago. I then posted on a thread about someone saying they wanted to kill themself and I just said "hey if you want to talk PM man, I know it's not much, but, I'm here to talk if you want".      Foreigncel took issue with that saying "incels don't want help from normies, they come here to vent and get support from fellow incels". he then goes on to post something with "suicide fuel" in the title after telling me I'm the reason people kill themself. I asked him how he can tell me I'm the reason people kill themself, after he literally posts something titled "suicide fuel".      He then tells me to fuck off normie, I don't understand blah blah.      There was another guy that I saw in a comment thread where he said "I have never recommended violence or anything like that in anything I've said." (horrible paraphrasing) went into his post history and there were at least 10 comments in the first 2 pages that were violent in nature. I responded with "really?" and linked the 10 comments.      THAT was also apparently not allowed.      I didn't give "general advice" (as that was against the sub rules) I just answered direct questions and offered a listening ear to those in need. Got banned by azavii (~~or w/e his name was~~bored at work, figured I'd find him) after someone said "~~/u/azaavi~~/u/azavii why isn't this guy banned yet?" he responded 2 minutes later with "done" and I was banned.      
Oh haha I totally read that wrong 😂 thanks for clarifying Gotta feel bad for black ops 2 dude tho
When that lonely man posts "I'm feeling sucidal!" And people gives him ways to do so and say that's the best course of action YOU FUCKING CAN If you guys had any fucking brain cells you wouldn't be incles. 
And I thought the cannon was that incels were pussies who wouldn’t do anything in real life?
[removed]
excuse me kind sir, but I’m a woman. And if you think that all men who settle down with women are chucks, I’m not going to be able to change that. All I know is that I never slept around, never rode the cock carousel, and contribute more than half to my combined family income.
Ok I’ll bite when did I use my virginity to justify predatory behavior? I don’t blame people for not “picking” me who would pick the autistic nerd with the condition most doctors can’t understand. By looks alone I wouldn’t date me. Not my fault nor their fault. Just simply biology. 
&gt;I responded with "really?" and linked the ten comments  But you were just trying to help, right? Lmao
Yep, Reddit sure lost something awesome...
[removed]
So you're defending the calls for rape and violence against women in your sub because of your biology?
Funny enough, foreign incel is now reformed incel, has a girlfriend and posts to inceltears. Not pinging anyone here because I'm not trying to pick a fight. 
What do you think "it's ovER" was alluding to?
/r/incels was self-destructive as hell, my dude.
Look around you, there are plenty of successful, functioning people without any of those features, because they don't choose to tell themselves that they're not good enough and that everyone else is better. You're the only one dragging yourself down, now it's time to get up.  Think of something you enjoy doing, join a club for it, be around people, you'll grow from there if you try. 
Only made 1 post there asking them if they would rather be blackpilled or have a gf most answered as predicted so I don’t know if I could call it my sub.   And those stories are mostly fictional  So unless you’ll also punish people for playing violent video-games while coping you a hypocrite.   And if those aren’t fictional I don’t agree with it.   Free market place of ideas y’all. 
that guy? not particularly. He was being extremely volatile. There were people in that sub that didn't want to do anything other than promote self loathing and negativity. He was one of them. It was a *LONG* conversation he had with someone in which lots of things were said. He was acting very high and mighty.      And even then, that isn't breaking any rules of the sub. He asked people to find examples of him doing it. I did. 
that dude hated me. CONSTANTLY berated me for the 2-3 days I posted. Followed me around telling me to get out. All I was trying to tell him and others was that I was there if they wanted to talk, and to not kill themselves.      also, good to know, good for him. Hope all is well for him. 
Man, I was being an ass on other posts and actually just apologized to the creator of the sub because I realize incels deserve a safe space for support, but you can’t form a sub with your mindset.  If you guys want a safe space to support each other it has to focus on bettering yourselves or just supporting each other rather than the hypocrisy you’re trying to spread. You complain that people hate you and are mean to you for looking different, while hating people and being mean to them  for looking different.   Let this be a safe space.  Let incels be people with real problems.  But don’t promote violence or hate.  Let the creator of the sub do what they intended and keep this place active. 
[removed]
Lmao, safe space my ass. Glorifying rape and suicide and dehumanizing 50% of the population because you can't get pussy is disgusting, and hopefully with the sub gone some of them'll reform themselves.
Bro, go lift and get a real hobby.  This incessant whining isn’t getting you anywhere.  
Nothing? It's a portmanteau of ER and "it's over". My flair on /r/incels was cold beER
Oh no 2 people I haven’t talked to nor seen content of talk about rape hold the press.   And the person being happy about the death. Sometimes it is just therapeutic to see someone else suffer. They are comparable to home videos but out to the nth degree.   I myself don’t really care about the death for the unknown niece.   I barely felt anything when my aunt died.  I felt more from my fathers reaction towards it. 
was dat
No but the sub needed to be banned tbh. Plenty of people there were already suicidal and the posts on there would encourage it.
Pentobarbital, aka Dr Nembutal.
Every sub is cucked, gotta leave this site. 
I mean there are a bunch of mass murders possibly committed by incels while only one high profile attack in the US has been committed by modern alt-right in recent history. So evidently incels are more dangerous.
At least somebody understands!
Yes, I am dumb for the simple fact that I am still here posting on cuckreddit
[removed]
I like arguing so I argue on the internet, that’s my main motivation for shit talking. I say a lot of really mean, really dumb shit because I’m looking at a phone and not a person. We all forget that there are people with entire lives on the other end of what we’re reading.  It’s easier to argue with someone who’s ideas I disagree with entirely, so when incels say I’m a whore and should be a sex slave, shit talking comes out like verbal vomit.    You’re right though.  All the people that incels refer to as Stacy or Chad or normie probably aren’t happy with their life. No one is, we all hate something about ourselves or our lives no matter how good it looks from the outside.    You’ve got to step away from the idea that you’re inferior looking. Maybe less attractive animals (including humans) don’t meet the standard for beauty, but that does not mean inferior. It simply means different, plenty of things in nature don’t look nice but are incredibly important parts of an ecosystem. “Looks aren’t everything” doesn’t just apply to people looking to have sex, it applies to everything in nature.   I’m rambling but I like this, you being able to speak your mind and me challenging that politely. I appreciate being able to hear your side and ideas. 
suicide lol
I made a post offering any local incels a chance to meet up with me in person and I'd help them. My wife works with a bunch of clients who are lonely middle aged women who might love a younger incel. I didn't tell them to shower or any personality crap. I said point blank anyone who wants to meet me in person I will help you out. I'm a normal guy but I was willing to walk the walk. I was banned because they were so furious about me having a wife and "bragging" about it. They don't want help and they never did. 
no fam, every ‘cel subreddit is being invaded by the downboat brigade. it seems that its open season on us, its an equivalent of an incel pogrom.
[removed]
Do Incels intentionally use generalizations and false stereotypes to promote a we-vs-them cavemen-like mentality?
Lol let's do it. Suicide pact! ^(jk I can't afford pento and my parents still care about me for some bizarre reason)
Seeing as cavemen aren’t the only ones that use it. No
They ban anything with related content. Idk why this place is still here, I guess the "brain" in the sub name must've fucked up whatever algorithm they use to hit alternate subs.
nahhhh life sucks but it’s probably better than not existing
Bullshit there are some above average mentalcels with approach anxiety. Why do you think this sub 8 cope bs popped up? Real incels are actually ugly, not autistic normies and chads.
Incels are dying and THIS is the normie response... And you people have the temerity to suggest that females and Jews face more oppression than Incels? DISGUSTING!
[removed]
Yes. Leave.
So you care about females being "raped" more than Incels committing suicide. Typical. /r/incels was a support group that has been taken away from victims because of *anti-Incel bigotry.*
[removed]
&gt;they make fun of short males (sub 5' 5").  We don't make fun of, we just tell people the truth that being sub 6'4 puts them at a *distinct* disadvantage. We also tell them the truth that roasties make fun of them behind their back for being short.
True tho. Lol.
Ok great I'll just lift my way to having better facial genetics and a taller height thanks for the advice normie very helpful.
Why do people keep repeating this like it's true? Admins can still see everything posted to a private subreddit 
That's hypocritical.
I feel like life's a lot of effort for nothing tho. I don't even care about material goods anymore.   School fucking sucks and work is probably gonna be even worse if I want to grind hard enough to get /r/financialindependence before automation gets my ass unemployed for good. That's honestly a far off dream too, all I'm good for is just loafing around on reddit and 4chan.   Every time I try for self-improvement I just give up after a couple weeks or so, the only thing I've improved on throughout my life are social and speaking skills which are obtained passively anyway so it's not even an accomplishment. All you have to do is ignore the pain in your stomach when making small talk to new people and then get their number and hang out with them. The fuck kind of accomplishment is that, there's no effort involved, only strategy.  Fuck why do I have to be the one piece of shit with a family that cares about me, I want to be free to end it already.  
Death is better than life, I'm envious of anyone that died last night or ever.
i wouldn't doubt it if people did sui 
I don't feel bad taking away a sub that encourages suicide, killing men and raping women on the daily and still has the gall to act like they're the victim. They're better off without a community that supports that behavior.

The incel was trying to get away with felony rape.  The legal advice people provide legal advice.
idk dude, im an older cel so im not insane like those memeing youngsters but i would be skepetical of this too.   it sounds a little out there meeting strangers excepting mental health professionals -  i agree therapy can help (unless you goddamn ugly as sin &amp; some of the cels are) - but im not meeting no husband &amp; wife just to be catfish paraded around.
Same thing most of the time.
Theyre worse than us, they sit there and screenshot our posts and make fun of us, yet they think they are the ones with morals
The fact that you just quoted "raped" tells me all i need to know about you. Go get help or go fuck yourself.
[removed]
It would just been me basically playing wingman to them. It may sound weird, but not as weird as incels talking about how hard it is to have a hot sister or mom who deprives them of sex lol... 
LOL. PLEASE explain.
I'm actually surprised, I thought from the name it would be pretentious af but this place is actually kinda chill. Kudos for managing to make an environment like this given how toxic the other incel subs got.
Plus you are being homophobic.
Sub 6'4"???? So you're saying Tom Brady is considered unattractive on the basis of *height* by most women?? Or Cristiano Ronaldo?? Lol.  And then there's dudes like Messi or Tom Cruise who are 5'6" and have women fainting over them...
I mentioned both, because both are destructive. Honestly if anyone who acted on the things people suggested in incels like rape I wouldn't care if they killed themselves, but for all the sad, angry men who never acted on this stuff, it doesn't help, it just makes them sadder, angrier and more isolated from normal society.
Tell that to your shrink, he can probably get you different meds that may or may not work better. 
&gt; Go get help  I was getting help and you cruel normies took away my support group!
Reddit is a private corporation. They have decided to allow only certain kinds of politics and world views to be expressed on their platform. That's completely within their right. Reddit is just a service we use - and we use it for free, no less. If you don't like it, you can always go elsewhere.

Bigot.  Reported.
That's a laugh.  You and your kind are just about as intellectually inferior as they come, what with all the leaps and stretches you have to pull off to get to any point where you feel superior.  The bottom line is that you are society's rejects.  You're not special, you're just...you're like that scum that accumulates under a stove burner.  Nothing especially harmful or consequential in any way, but a minor annoyance and you smell bad.  Have fun with that, and every other instance of your complete inferiority to us "normies."
Boom
Well, maybe you should consider a different way out, then.
They do, you idiot.  Stop deluding yourself.  You're just a loser who can't get laid.  Those other things you're talking about have ACTUAL problems.  You face only the oppression you bring on yourself.
And at 40, I hear you guys get wizard powers too!
I rest my case.
Actually my father lived in classical stalinism in Hungary.  He basically told the stalinists to go to hell.  And in the 1956 revolt, he threw molotov cocktails in the air vent of soviet tanks.  But maybe I shouldn't talk about that since reddit may interpret this as promoting violence. 
As long as you actually police the truly fucking horrible content that details how to rape and kill innocent people, we're good.
Of course I won't allow such content. It's against the rules, illegal according to US law, and, most importantly of all, it is *not* high-quality content.
Bruh. No offence but Peter Dinklage is sexy as fuck and the only way he’d be 6’4 is if I threw him as high as I could. 
Yes I’m pretty sure they magically found out who said person was and sent threats to him. /s
I really wanted to hear his definition of hypocritical.
Get shoe lifts and a chin implant and be done with it. 
It’s one way of trying to bring him out of the incel cycle -  point out the flaws and hypocrisy he had in order to make him realise his shittiness. 
Hope he’s proud.
This sub will be banned soon too.  😀
please stop bullying us
Reported for trying to skirt Reddit’s rules.   Sorry incels.   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Reported for time-traveling and retroactively avoiding a ban seventeen days before the ban was even in place?  Ok then
Approve me in r/incel4now

Yes, that sub promote rape and murder.
Why do you not use the subs actual name? is it just so you can use a homophobic insult?
Beauty is subjective. Humans tend to be drawn to many traits that are not necessarily indications of beauty. For instance, social homogeneity might have a French girl be more attracted to a french boy over an English boy who is more attractive. Our brains are also programmed to be more attracted to people who resemble us or our parents (another type of homogeneity) so a a freckled red head might be more inclined to go in a date with the ginger Connor even though the blond Richard is more objectively attractive. Of course, many studies have shown that when perusing long term relations both men and women are more interested in personality than looks. While it is true that psychical attractiveness is more weighted in initial meetings, the longer you know someone the less important looks become. Consider all the couple you know. Unless you are a statistical outlier, the majority of FWB and romantic relationships will have known each other a significant amount of time before beginning their relationship.   If you are having troubles with confidence and self worth, I would encourage you to seek mental health care. Cognitive therapy can do wonders with such things if you can find a doctor that you work well with. That’s not to say you have a mental illness, everyone can benefit from seeing a therapist. Just like how we can go to a doctor over a cold without having a long term, permanent illness, it is beneficial to check in with mental health doctors as well. You can ask any MD for a referral or look up local therapist online. 
Bruh, you weren't getting any help. You were just festering in your misery. These guys aren't qualified to help you. Get actual help. You'll feel much better once you do. 
Who died?
How do you know it's better?
Ok so here's a list of all the incels who died last night:
What does "Normie" mean? sorry, new to reddit.
Average person who doesn't spend all of their time wallowing in self-imposed exile on a subreddit full of dudes who constantly tell you to kill yourself.
then you should start ban hammering or the downboat brigade will trample all over you.  i like free speech as much as the next person but shitposting is pointless and no actual content of value is discussed.  edit: make me a mod and i will clean up the filth in this place, and i will leave intelligent opposing and supportive ideas.  well it might not matter, the mothership has sailed offshore and the people online here are trollers now. the rest have fled to the new incels forum.
Aww, poor oppressed men have had their safe space banned.

Damn you missed all the great posts. Ah well. IncelTears can show you a few 
Aren't you doing exactly that with your noncontributory comment?
Absence of something that's bad is better then its presence.

So does that mean "Incel" is another way of saying "glutton for punishment"? Why the hell would anyone want to deal with that? Also, seriously, what the hell does Incel even mean? 
So you can bully women?  Fuckin lol
It is a thing mostly unintelligent people do.
No one made fun of your height or even brought it up. You did.
[removed]
Whats he got in his ears?
no bully please i'm very sensitive
Yeah! Give’em hell! Women are the worst, they totally extinted dinosaurs! 
Stop blaming women for your problems you brought onto yourself
Already nuked lol
all they do is sense your horrible attitude
i don't know if it might be of any help or encouragement to you, but some people who don't even have to deal with being an incel already have issues with normal conversations. so all i want to tell you is that what you have been doing is still an accomplishment even if it feels as if you didn't have to put any effort into it. don't be so hard on yourself and dont forget that small accomplishments are still accomplishments.
Well that's just not fair, everyone should have equal access to fairy tales!!
One thing I've learned is that the people who constantly threaten suicide are looking for help. I know a few people who killed themselves and they never said a word about it. People on incels would literally talk about plotting their suicide months or years down the line if X didn't happen. That is so unhealthy for people to read. 
Hey virgins, I’m a woman 
Omg 
I question the limits of free speech as an ideal when applied to situations on the extreme ends of the bell curve. This community is a special case; we are under attack by the vast majority of reddit and also dealing with incels who would shitpost and otherwise not adhere to the sub's rules. It's a unique situation.
[Here's another good link regarding the Bolsheviks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_uprisings_against_the_Bolsheviks )  My own experiences with the reddit communists and their staunch adherence to sexual capitalism and Chad hegemony has reminded me that the words of Engels are more relevant than ever before:  &gt;“Marx and [I have] fought harder all our lives against the alleged Socialists than against anyone else.”
**Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks**  The left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks by rival left-wing parties that started soon after the October Revolution, continued through the Russian Civil War, and lasted into the first few years of Soviet rule. They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued during and after the Civil War until around 1923. The Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to invite these groups to join the government and instead suppressed them with force.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Braincels/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I think you're correct.  If the regular users trust my judgement, I'm willing to temporarily assume a "if I don't like it, it's gone" mentality in regard to low-quality posts, even if they don't necessarily violate Reddit's content policy.  But, again, only temporary. My hope is that once the shitposters get bored/banned and fuck off, we can have a diverse range of viewpoints while still maintaining a high-quality subreddit.
This post is ridiculous in so many ways. Not all incels are nervous around females, not all hesitate to approach, not all are ugly, not all just want sex... It's just a bunch of insane generalizations that don't apply to most of them. 
&gt;The blackpill itself is just lookism, the intuitive reality that looks matter.   Except that this is not reality, and thus is isn't a pill of any kind. 
You can't have a high quality sub with no moderation rules. That's completely impossible. It's like saying "I want no robberies, so I will leave the bank vaults open all night with no guards"
Strict moderation kills community culture.  That's exactly what happened to incels. azavii and the others banned anyone who didn't tow the party line and we ended up with a horrific monstrosity utterly devoid of reason or purpose. 
&gt;Strict moderation kills community culture.  But you don't have any moderation.  &gt;That's exactly what happened to incels. azavii and the others banned anyone who didn't tow the party line and we ended up with a horrific monstrosity utterly devoid of reason or purpose.  No, as much as I despise Azavii he had a bunch of rules that were ok and he upheld them. You have no rules so your sub will turn into something much worse very soon because same people will come to your sub and they won't even have rules this time. 
&gt;But you don't have any moderation.  Fuck you I don't have any moderation. I've deleted at least a dozen posts today and banned two people.  &gt;No, as much as I despise Azavii he had a bunch of rules that were ok and he upheld them. You have no rules so your sub will turn into something much worse very soon because same people will come to your sub and they won't even have rules this time.  My sub will turn into an incel Renaissance. Not only will we restore the glory days of /r9k/ and Wizardchan, but we will significantly surpass their accomplishments. Our consciousness itself will imprint upon society and forever be intertwined with humanity as we know it. We're not looking for a small cult here, we're looking for a fundamental shift in the nature of reality.   And it's working. Not three weeks after I left r/incels and created this sub, the former was deleted and r/braincels became the new flagship of incel culture. Before this time next year, it's entirely possible that we will be one of the most popular and high-quality subreddits. All of my wildest dreams are coming true, because I'm basically a visionary.
It’s funny how every religion is against fornication
Really, the harassment and spam global rules have given me all I need to keep this sub good. In fact, I can't think of any rules to add that wouldn't be an affront to freedom itself.  I refuse to institute a blanket ban on women or nonvirgins. I believe both can provide valuable input. 
As I said, an expected reply. Of course no sane sub would want you to ban nonvirgins or women. Or even noncels.  I mentioned completely different examples in my first post. You have no protection against this, which is why people should stay the fuck away from your sub. 
Lookism isn't really? I think Cucktears is the sub for you
Why don't you make the sub private or approved submitter only for a week? The normies will always come when you're busy or asleep so everyday you'll come back to chaos until this thing blows over (normies have no attention spans so it won't be long).  You can also use the opportunity to delete most of the recent threads and basically make it so this never happened.  I am writing an intellectual piece that I want to post but will not because I know that in this environment it will be either brigaded or completely ignored because of all the shitposts going on around it. In other words, you're losing quality content because of this.  I can say with near certainly anyone else considering posting something right now is also holding off for similar reasons. And if you left the shitposting go/downvoting go, it just turns into an endless cycle.  Wipe the shitposts and we'll try again.
No. You don't understand how this works, The more popular your sub gets the more clueless people it will attract. Why do you think that sub had to close every week or so? People aren't going to go away. More and more clueless idiots will show up. 
&gt; I believe both can provide valuable input.   I don't know, all their brigading and spamming their anti-virgin bigotry is hardly valuable.
&gt;You must understand that the NEET lifestyle afforded to the Incel allows him to gain wisdom that normies lack.  No, I mustn't understand. Why would that be? Why wouldn't somebody be wise and spend all time, say, in a library while having a sane non-feminist girlfriend? 
The mods of r/incels are power hungry assholes. They ban you for not joining in their little misogynistic rapey circlejerk.
Bullshit, most NEETs end up rotting their brains lurking 4chan and playing shit games. 
Grow thicker skin this is an embarrassing statement 
God forbid anyone ever calls your whiny backwards ass out. Oh no.

It’s short for Involuntary Celibate, but the community on Reddit essentially evolved into a community similar to other “pill” communities (redpill /bluepill) with its own social theories and philosophies. The community became a great way for incels to cope with their life
Well in theory that sounds like it’s a good idea
How to combine quality and popularity?  Popularity means appealing to the moronic masses who hate quality.  Quality means censoring the stupidity of the moronic masses which results in unpopularity.  One may say "Just pick quality.  Forget about the moronic masses."  But anything of pure quality will be so obscure due to unpopularity that the few intelligent people left in our godforsaken moronic world would not be able to find it.  Quite a dilemma.  I will propose a solution.  Make a second sub named something like BestOfBraincels.  The sub should only contain links to high quality posts on Braincels.  This sub should be ruthlessly censored to remove all low quality content.  There should be an announcement on Braincels linking directly to this new sub.  The morons can't complain since they can still post in Braincels.  So Braincels would have the popularity and the new sub would have the quality.  The quality sub would get exposure from the announcement link on the popular Braincels sub.  So this combines quality and popularity by linking them but keeping them separate to avoid the intrinsic conflict. 
I mean it got really dark and the community did not interact well with outsiders (and that’s putting it nicely lmao)  Edit: not sure why it’s getting downvoted. It’s a fact that the incel community was absolutely bullied by the outsiders.
my thing is that the trolls need to be kicked out swift and fast.   if you can string paragraphs of thought then it should stand, regardless if people disagree or not.  a lot of the brigaders are drive by trolls. if you banhammer a mass of them immediately, then that sends a warning to others that we dont fuck around and we’ll kick trash to the curb where it belongs.  edit: did... did celdiscussions get banned also?
Normies make fun of people who are 5'10, so don't be surprised.
Ok.
delete this subreddit now
While I agree with everything written here, this thread should be removed.  We live under Stalinism and Stalinism cannot tolerate the truth.  If you lived under Stalin, you would have been sent to the gulags.  What good does that do?  So self-censorship is needed.  If you want to speak freely, go to a mosque.

Hi /u/StoicExercise, thanks for coming.  An incel is someone who can't have a relationship with the opposite sex, despite their best efforts. Contrary to popular belief, most incels do not focus on sex and it's more about a relationship and intimacy. Social connections are very important for humans and going without them for an entire lifetime can be crippling for people.  Most agree that incels are the way they are because of their looks. This reality is known as "lookism" or the blackpill. What the blackpill means for society as a whole is a lively source of debate here.  Incels occupy a wide variety of positions in society, ranging from successful tech professionals to NEETs. Some may have many friends and be very outgoing, while others are reserved and shy. The only thing all incels have in common is involuntary celibacy.  Many people feel threatened by us and want to harm our communities. Some of these people could even be considered incels themselves. They do this for many reasons, ranging from sheer bullying to personal insincerity. Our communities are insulated and rarely interact with others, we just want to be left to ourselves like most other communities are. 
Reddit did ban a cuckqueers mod for doxxing incels.
It’s a pretty good channel.  Love Orphan Black.
Agreed, Top Gear was a very good show during it's run
"Validation comes from sex."  You're doing self esteem wrong.   Inceldom is not normal or natural and like anything in life can be changed. But if you go into the incel echo chamber you can be damn sure it's going to get worse. You're going to get more depressed being constantly reminded of your negative and likely unfactual thoughts. You haven't been defeated. You've given up bettering yourself because you don't have the tools to cope with the emotional ups and downs of life. But you can learn to deal with rejection in a healthy way anytime in your life. Well you can but if you're this far into this self defeating premise then you probably will never take the first step to actually living happy and healthy.
why wouldn't we make fun of you for not being able to get laid?
Jesus fuck. Reading that was a good laugh.
We don’t bully you because you cannot get laid.  That’s a fact of life for many people of either sex and it is unfortunate.  We do mock some of you for being rampant misogynists.  
suggestion: make me a mod and i will clean up anything that’s dumb &amp; trolling; i will keep the coherent posts (even if i disagree with it).
Fornicators also don't inherit the toothfairy kingdom.  sweatin bullets over here m8.
Talking to yourself and reinforcing your own worldview is definitely superior to exposing yourselves to people with contradictory views and having discussions with them.  That much is obvious.

Too many face pubes, can't watch
Truth be told I have had one intellectually stimulating convo with a female my whole life. It's whether the law exists because people are shit and if it didn't exist there would be anarchy. She was of the view there wouldn't be anarchy (stupid).
Incels make these outrageous claims about black pills and calling women degenerates and everyone who disagrees with them cucks.  Then when you refute everything they say, they try to reduce it to "It's hard for ugly people to get a girlfriend, normies agree!!!"  Well no shit.  That isn't a bitter black pill, though, that's common sense that everyone knows already.  And no one is arguing against that.  If your entire ideology was just that, people would be sympathetic to you, but you layer on loads of bullshit and hate on top of it.  And that is what people have a problem with.  On top of that r/incels had a poll and half the people there said their problem was mental, not looks.  So your idea that it's all about looks is flat out wrong. http://web.archive.org/web/20171017141440/https://www.reddit.com/r/Incels/comments/76pu1w/how_many_of_you_are_actually_ugly_vs_plain/  Where are all the "very ugly" people?  It's all average or "below average" people or people with mental disorders.  If anything it's more like only 5% or some low percentage of incels are actually "very ugly".

I’m taking it as a compliment. Only celebrities have this happen to them
Tell you what, I'm a pretty ordinary schlub, about average in every physical way, I'd like to think I'm a little smarter than Joe Everydude but not a Nobel physicist or anything, but certainly not Chad the charismatic musician with rock-hard abs or whatever it is. And yet--take a seat if you need to--I get laid. I have romantic relationships. They're not always great. They end, eventually. I haven't figured everything out about myself, let alone other people. But you've got a couple of misconceptions that make me want to take a crack at unpacking this here short screenplay.  &gt;these highly intelligent and sophisticated creatures.  Coming as it does right on the heels of phrases like "fourteen-dimensional human beans," I've gotta say this sure seems like you don't really consider women to be intelligent or sophisticated. It seems like sarcasm. Here's the thing. You know how you can usually tell what someone really thinks of you, even if they try to hide it? Well, so can women.  &gt;You: Hey, substance, substance, substance substance, substance. Several sentences of substance.  See, that's actually not a very good way to start a conversation with *anyone*, whether you're trying to get laid or not. Usually, what we do is we say, "Hello," or some other salutation like that. If we don't know the person--and let's just assume that you don't know this woman--we would say something to the effect of "What is your name?" It doesn't have to be those exact words, I'm just giving you guidelines here. Feel free to make it your own.  Now what might happen here, early in this conversation, is that she'll communicate to you that she's not interested in having a conversation. What you want to do if that happens is fuck off. She's not playing mind games, she's actually literally telling you the truth. And she has the right to do that! Sure, you could refuse to leave her alone, but that's what assholes do, and I know you're not an asshole. Right?  But a lot of times, she won't tell you to get lost. Great! Let's keep going. What we do now is we continue the process of getting to know someone. This isn't necessary in EVERY conversation with a random stranger, but if you have the inkling that you might want to be friends or more than friends with someone, you REALLY have to do it. And it's actually fun, if you care about other human beings and have any sense of empathy, which of course, you do, right? Of course you do. I don't even know why I asked.  Getting to know someone takes time. It might even take more than one conversation! And yes, it is absolutely harder if you're not Sexy Chad with the rock-hard abs, but dude, it is literally your fault that you're not as hot as Sexy Chad. It's my fault that I'm not as hot as Sexy Chad. I'd like to be, but I don't want to put in the work. It sounds like a drag. Every time I've tried it, it was a drag. Not worth it. But I don't get to complain when I have to put in more effort to get laid, and neither do you.  &gt;Her: lol. idk?  OK, I'm gonna guess that what you did here was you just launched into a dissertation about something you like, or are knowledgeable about, or are interested in. Physics, politics, Yu-Gi-Oh cards, baseball, who knows. It's great to have interests and hobbies and passions. But nobody likes being talked at. And that's what you did here. You talked at her. People--including women--generally prefer to have conversations, not exchanges of extemporaneous filibusters.  So "lol. idk?" doesn't at all mean what you think it means. It means "I don't know who you are, guy. What was all that about?" It means "I don't actually share your interest in that subject." It means "I am nervous about where this interaction is going, because I'm pretty sure it ends with you screaming at me and calling me a whore."  &gt;You: More sentences of substance. Would you like to get together some time?  Why? What basis do the two of you have for hanging out? All you've done is talk at her and she has expressed ZERO interest in you. You can't just manufacture desire when it isn't there. You gotta put in some effort, man, and in this scenario, you haven't done that.  &gt;Her: Maybe. idk  NO. SHE IS SAYING NO. TAKE THE HINT. You blew it this time, buddy. Take the L and work on your game like the rest of us.  &gt;Yummy Chad: hey Her: hey! :D  Hold on. You're telling me that this woman was attracted to an attractive man? Blow me tight, that's a mystery.  &gt;Yummy Chad: Netflix and chill at 8? Her: Sure! :d :p  Nope. Didn't happen.  &gt;If it's not pretty pictures, exclamation points, emoticons, inspirational quotes, shoes, dresses, skirts, fakeup, coffee, cooking recipes and pretty pixx of food, or her pet dog (and/or pet child who is HER WORLD), she's not going to care about that.  Guy, I'm not going to say there are no women out there who only care about bullshit. There are. Just like there are guys who only care about bullshit. But if those are the only women you encounter, the problem is YOU. I almost NEVER encounter those women. The wonderful women in my life--friends of mine--are people I went to college with, talked about life and the nature of reality and the universe with, argued politics with, worked with, laughed with, cried with, struggled with. Because the first principle of my interactions with any human being is, I want to find out if this person is cool and interesting, and if this person is cool and interesting, I want this person to be part of my life if it's at all possible. It's not "I want to fuck." And sometimes, it works out that you get to fuck! Sometimes it works out that you get to be in a loving romance. Most of the time it doesn't, and that's fine.  If the only women you encounter are shallow idiots, then you need to elevate your life.
Are you making the claim that incels are not a subgroup of the alt-right? Because you're gonna have a mighty hard time convincing me of that.
When people go to this subreddit, it should just redirect to this post. Subreddit completed.   You're a good person for taking the time to write this, and if the mods delete it, they will be -seriously, considering the core viewership here- doing an immoral thing.
I have said no to a woman. I have had women say no to me. Which, by the way, that's what it's called. "Saying no." It's not a "rejection." At any rate, neither situation played out the way you seem to think it would.  First scenario:  ME: You know, I think you're looking for something from me that I can't give you right now. I'm sorry, you're a sweet woman, but I just don't think we'd be right together.  HER: I was worried you'd say that. It hurts, but I understand. Thank you for being honest with me.  *no one jumps out of the bushes to call me a pig*  *fin*  Second scenario:  ME: (whatever hackneyed shit I said to her to try and dress up my attraction)  HER: Well, I don't think anything like that is going to happen.  ME: I figured as much, but I felt like I should say it anyway.  *no one jumps out of the bushes to tell her she has balls*  *fin*
I'd like to think that at least one person will read it and have the a-ha moment of like, "Oh, you gotta have a two-way conversation. Okay, that makes sense." That's pretty much the key. You nail that part and all the rest of this nonsense falls away.
...why did you even type all that out? Who gives a shit?   Nobody should need that many words to throw platitudes at a guy memeing about women. Get a hold of yourself.  
I give a shit. I give a shit that people who identify as "incels" are committing serious violence against women, raping and murdering women, because they have convinced themselves that women owe them sex and that the fact that they aren't receiving sex is a justification for vengeance.  I don't think you know what a platitude is. If what I said was "platitudes," there wouldn't be so many men who don't get it. And this shit is not just harmless venting on the internet. We are living in a time in which the dregs of the internet affect the world in real and horrifying ways. Incels/redpillers/MRAs attacking women. Fascists and ethno-nationalists rising to power all over the globe. Even ISIS recruitment starts out with online outreach in many cases.  If one person reads what I wrote and realizes that actually, having a two-way conversation with a woman is the way to go, then great. One guy is less likely to be a mass shooter. If not, all I wasted was five minutes.
I hope so too. And honestly, with the massive influx of viewers that I imagine this subreddit is having at the moment, I bet it will.
So you want to tell me that women are going to be that diplomatic with you since you rejected them? I was insulted by some girls just by refusing them.
But you're still a cucc xdddddd
You said "before any objectionable content even showed up." Which means you were expecting it to show up.
I'm guessing the dude is still an asshole. I hope he's treating his girlfriend better than he is almost certainly treating her.
LOL.  I'm the dude cucks hit up to plow their woman.\
I care more about women--that's what they're called, by the way--being raped than lonely men talking about being suicidal instead of getting a haircut and taking a shower and developing a sense of humor.
I just need to jump in here. You think No Man's Sky was the objectively worst game ever made? Kids these days, don't even remember Daikatana or Superman 64.
Are you real?
&gt;lookism cannot be denied.  OK, let's say for the sake of argument that "lookism" is a thing. First, are you suggesting that people should have to fuck someone they're not attracted to? Second, I'd like you to get an account on OKCupid. It's free. Answer some of their silly questions, fill out the profile, upload a picture, then just leave it alone. If that site is anything like it was a couple years ago, you will get messages from women within a few months. They won't be the hottest women on the planet, but they're women and they're looking for a man. You gonna walk the walk on "lookism"?  &gt;Reading one heavily upvoted bluepill comment after another, all expressing the theme of "sex/love are not important, I'm basically incel but it's fine because I do X Y and Z" showed me that the bluepill is a socially acceptable form of cope.  You are right that not thinking you are owed sex by any woman you desire is more socially acceptable.  &gt;and by proactive, i mean acknowledging the unfairness of it and being upset.  That is very much not what "proactive" means. That is not proactive, reactive, or active in any sense. That is inactive. That is passive.  &gt;Regardless, their advice to incels is that we don't need sex and relationships - in other words, we can (and should) accept and adjust to a life without it.  You're missing something very important, which is that if you stop treating sex and relationships like they're oxygen, you will have much better luck with both.
Also it would be fine if you slept around, because people can do what they want and it's fine.

Feminists raped 24 women and killed 13 men in last 7 days. Yet you people claim the moral high ground.
Well, I'm sure you believe that.
OK, I just browsed through your comment history. Dude, you are a CHILD. Literally. I'm not saying that as an insult. You are a child. You are in school, sounds like middle school to me, because I never heard of a high school student caring about who stole a pen.  So you are, what, 12? 14 at most? And you're calling yourself "involuntarily celibate"? You have your *entire life* ahead of you! You should not be having sex yet! You're way too young! Who got in your head and told you that you should be having sex already?
I don't mean this in a bad way either but it seems like it's you who has reading comprehensions of a middle schooler.  "Let's say" you missed that before reading the rest of sentence. I was paralleling the ban on our sub with that story.    Never let your emotions blur your vision. You opened my profile in desperate hope to have something to get me and that hammered your ability to be objective.
That's pretty much how it went down, yeah. It was a long time ago, so I'm sure I got a few of the words wrong, but that was it pretty much. It was an awkward, tough conversation, but she and I didn't have much in common. We had met at a work thing, ended up sloppily drunk having sex behind a dumpster in an alley--true story--but as we got to know each other, I could see that she was looking for more than I was, and that we just weren't compatible on a personality level. She was a few years older than me and clearly looking for a long-term life partner; I was not looking for that. She was an economic conservative; I'm a socialist. On and on. So even though I knew it was going to be a touch, emotional thing, I just did it and got it over with, and it actually wasn't that bad. I felt not that great, and obviously it wasn't a great night for her, but we went our separate ways and it was fine.  So I'm guessing that you didn't just "say no" to a woman. Which, by the way, wouldn't that make you voluntarily celibate? Since you had a choice?
If you were grown, you would have used an example that a grown-up would use. You didn't. You used the example of stealing a pen and the whole school bullying you and losing your crush.  Also, diving deeper into your comment history, you tend to use words slightly incorrectly. Like "demographic," for instance. That doesn't mean you're definitely a child, but it fits.  Anyway, buddy, try and cheer up about life. See a therapist. You've most likely got decades ahead of you to figure out how to date women. There's a 97% chance that you'll succeed.
Looking forward to dating in my seventies, just the thought of sharing the same hospital room gives me goosebumps. 
See? You've already got a better attitude!
Yea attractive women turn you down and you turn down your female equivalent... Almost like you're willing to remain celibate, seeing as you're turning them down willing... 
Yea it's almost like the myth that the geneticly inferior men are still men... Looking at you op. 
I'm not part of the brigade. I hope this sub gets realized in the image you intend for it. Good luck m'dude. You guys need a place to do your thing in peace. Respect
why can't you get laid?  ----  EDIT  Hey folks, continue reading this thread if you want to see /u/foreignincel3, a self-admitted college aged virgin, make fun of me for not getting laid in two weeks lol.
right now i am uni and cant tell you why, feel free to visit my history if you want to know more about me , what about you why cant you get laid
No incel is doing that, we are that short virgin kid who got bullied in highschool and dont leave his house, we only seek true consensual validation, and dont call me a sexist murderer , because i am a feminist
I can get laid but at the moment I'm not actively pursuing that because I'm focusing more on work and a cross country trip I have planned for this month.  Kind of busy with training.  I could pull up some tit pics from old lays if you want though.  If you're not gonna tell me I'm good, I don't care enough to go through your shit.  being at college is like a pussy buffet so your reply only makes me more confused as to why you can't get your dick wet.
&gt; i am busy this is why i dont get laid    lmao right buddy getting laid is nothing special you hit that and you go with your day keep coping
I mean if I was that worried about it I could go hit up a local spot and find someone to bring home, but I'm pretty sure I'll survive going ~2 weeks without getting laid.  
&gt; i am not getting laid now because i am sooo busy but  i can pull some tits from the "ooold" days   &gt;get confronted   &gt;well its only been two weeks haha   man wtf hahahaha typical redpiller crybaby  hahahhaahhahaHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAVHAHAHAHAVAVVAVAVAVAVVAVAVAVAVAVAVAHVAVAVAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHZHAHH
No.
Heck no.
Oh just shut your big yapper.
yep, 2 weeks is an eternityyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, i ded
You’re right about that. I shouldn’t be compelled to defend my own personal sexual choices. I suspect the actual amount of sexual partners a woman has had has nothing to do with why these guys hate women. It’s the fact that none of the sexual partners have been incels.
&gt; You reject a girl, you are a pig.  can you cite your source?  I've turned down plenty of women and no one gave a shit, including them usually.  &gt; normies still adulate their golden pussy (from urine ofc)  I take it you're not aware of the fact that where you put your penis, and where a girl pees, are not the same spot on their body?
will register
Dis is y u incel. Okay so I change up the interaction to have a greeting first, maybe even some clever one liner or something. It still ends the same way
Caamib is a fakecel 
Hey OP how old are you?    I'm curious how many years you've existed without managing a meaningful conversation with 5 out of every 10 folks you see in life.
Misogynist normies? I've never rolled my eyes as hard as I did now.
Lmfao
This is why your sub is gone. You can’t go ten seconds without being an insecure asshole. 
[removed]
/r/suicidewatch is right there for whoever actually wants help. Don’t act like anyone on that godforsaken sub cared about recovering  
You might actually get through to these self-flagellating, violently misogynistic shitlords!  I mean, it would take years to undo the kind of toxic mentality that incels have built up around themselves like a personal shield, but hey, it's a good first step lol
Hah! You're a class Act, JZ XD
I mean you can call yourself a feminist, but it doesn't make you one. If you have the incel mindset, you're just a toxic, spiteful man. 
Ok, I got it, you want to say that I must not have standards.
Yep. Its nice over there.
People are saying that you can have standards, but so can women. You need to stop pretending like men and women are from different planets and that one is better than the other. We are literally the same species. We all have internal dialogue, insecurities, sexual preferences, not just you.  You don’t get to hate on people and expect them to like you, you don’t get to disrespect people and expect them to be polite to you. 
Pushing 33. My experience is what led me to the conclusion that AWALT. 
So what kind of industry do you work in that there are never any intelligible women around?  20 years ago I used to bar-back at this dive joint near a college and even at that shit hole I had some philosophical 3am convos over brew.
Who said clever one liners? HE SAID GET TO KNOW HER!!!!  You don’t get to see someone and decide it’s time to act, you have to put work in to it. It takes work to look good, it takes work to feel good, it takes work to make money and friends and that is why you’re an incel. Because it’s easier to blame everyone but yourself instead of actually doing the work. 
&gt;Tell you what, I'm a pretty ordinary schlub, about average in every physical way, I'd like to think I'm a little smarter than Joe Everydude but not a Nobel physicist or anything, but certainly not Chad the charismatic musician with rock-hard abs or whatever it is. And yet--take a seat if you need to--I get laid. I have romantic relationships. They're not always great. They end, eventually. I haven't figured everything out about myself, let alone other people. But you've got a couple of misconceptions that make me want to take a crack at unpacking this here short screenplay.  How novel. You state an unreliable analysis of your own looks, then state that you have had relationships with the opposite sex.   &gt;Coming as it does right on the heels of phrases like "fourteen-dimensional human beans," I've gotta say this sure seems like you don't really consider women to be intelligent or sophisticated. It seems like sarcasm.   Impressive. I'm glad you picked up on the heavy sarcasm.  &gt;Here's the thing. You know how you can usually tell what someone really thinks of you, even if they try to hide it? Well, so can women.  This looks made up to me. As in, you just pulled that out of your ass.  Could they really tell what their physical abusers thought of them? Well, if they could, they obviously didn't care.  But then you have the Ted Bundy types, where I would think they would at least care a little about their impending murder. So it's almost like they can't tell at all, and this is just make-believe on the part of people who think there is a solution for all of life's problems. As the late George Carlin once said, "if you honestly think there's a solution, you are part of the problem."  &gt;See, that's actually not a very good way to start a conversation with anyone, whether you're trying to get laid or not. Usually, what we do is we say, "Hello," or some other salutation like that. If we don't know the person--and let's just assume that you don't know this woman--we would say something to the effect of "What is your name?" It doesn't have to be those exact words, I'm just giving you guidelines here. Feel free to make it your own.  I take it you haven't seen the females on dating websites insisting that they want a well thought out message...not to just say "hey" or "what's up?"   &gt;Now what might happen here, early in this conversation, is that she'll communicate to you that she's not interested in having a conversation. What you want to do if that happens is fuck off. She's not playing mind games, she's actually literally telling you the truth. And she has the right to do that! Sure, you could refuse to leave her alone, but that's what assholes do, and I know you're not an asshole. Right?  Yeah, which totally explains why she swiped right.  My experiences with females in conversations mimmic those who actually get laid. Intelligent Chads agree with me. Females do not make good conversationalists with males.  Also, saying nothing is not the same as telling someone to "get lost." Saying "get lost" is the same as telling someone to "get lost."  Females seem to think that they don't even have to tell you that your advances are unwelcome in order for it to be sexual harassment.   &gt;But a lot of times, she won't tell you to get lost.   This is only true if she finds you attractive. For us, this is false. She will *always* want us to get lost.   &gt;Great! Let's keep going.  This is dripping with obnoxious snark. Do you really think a condescending message like this is the way to go about changing our minds?   &gt;What we do now is we continue the process of getting to know someone. This isn't necessary in EVERY conversation with a random stranger, but if you have the inkling that you might want to be friends or more than friends with someone, you REALLY have to do it. And it's actually fun, if you care about other human beings and have any sense of empathy, which of course, you do, right? Of course you do. I don't even know why I asked.  More condescending snark.  &gt;Getting to know someone takes time. It might even take more than one conversation!  Another snarky exclamation point.  &gt;And yes, it is absolutely harder if you're not Sexy Chad with the rock-hard abs, but dude, it is literally your fault that you're not as hot as Sexy Chad. It's my fault that I'm not as hot as Sexy Chad. I'd like to be, but I don't want to put in the work.  You seem to think that male looks are about going to the gym. Have you heard of this thing called, "face?"  &gt;It sounds like a drag. Every time I've tried it, it was a drag. Not worth it. But I don't get to complain when I have to put in more effort to get laid, and neither do you.  I would have to put in the plastic surgery, and even then, it wouldn't be enough.   &gt;OK, I'm gonna guess that what you did here was you just launched into a dissertation about something you like, or are knowledgeable about, or are interested in. Physics, politics, Yu-Gi-Oh cards, baseball, who knows. It's great to have interests and hobbies and passions. But nobody likes being talked at. And that's what you did here. You talked at her. People--including women--generally prefer to have conversations, not exchanges of extemporaneous filibusters.  You're guessing this based on absolutely nothing. I could have been talking about something *she* liked. Women do not converse with even Chad. Look at the second conversation. You see how she's no more talkative in the second conversation? This is the extent to which all of Chad's conversations go with her. The only difference is she is excited to hear from him and wants to get to the hanging out/sex.  The point sailed over your head by a country mile.  &gt;So "lol. idk?" doesn't at all mean what you think it means. It means "I don't know who you are, guy. What was all that about?" It means "I don't actually share your interest in that subject." It means "I am nervous about where this interaction is going, because I'm pretty sure it ends with you screaming at me and calling me a whore."  This is laughable. You're trying to insert intelligent meanings into the empty messages of airheads.   Her comment means, "what's all this smart person stuff? I just want to put on my nail polish and watch Real Housewives."  &gt;Why? What basis do the two of you have for hanging out? All you've done is talk at her and she has expressed ZERO interest in you. You can't just manufacture desire when it isn't there. You gotta put in some effort, man, and in this scenario, you haven't done that.  How are you supposed to put in effort when she's not interested in talking to you? Your response makes absolutely no sense. Your only intent is on being a condescending asshole, but it's couched in this pretense that you're trying to help.  &gt;NO. SHE IS SAYING NO. TAKE THE HINT. You blew it this time, buddy. Take the L and work on your game like the rest of us.  There is no such thing as "game." She just doesn't find you physically attractive.  &gt;Hold on. You're telling me that this woman was attracted to an attractive man? Blow me tight, that's a mystery.  It's almost like that's the whole point of this satire and that somehow sailed over your head, because you're a pretentious dipshit who outsmarts himself. It's almost like the point is that females suck at conversation, and the only thing that matters in getting laid is being good-looking. You're not smarter than Joe Everydude. You wouldn't even get to be President in Idiocracy.  &gt;Nope. Didn't happen.  Yet, the Netflix didn't happen. Sex did.  &gt;Guy, I'm not going to say there are no women out there who only care about bullshit. There are. Just like there are guys who only care about bullshit. But if those are the only women you encounter, the problem is YOU. I almost NEVER encounter those women. The wonderful women in my life--friends of mine--are people I went to college with, talked about life and the nature of reality and the universe with, argued politics with, worked with, laughed with, cried with, struggled with. Because the first principle of my interactions with any human being is, I want to find out if this person is cool and interesting, and if this person is cool and interesting, I want this person to be part of my life if it's at all possible. It's not "I want to fuck." And sometimes, it works out that you get to fuck! Sometimes it works out that you get to be in a loving romance. Most of the time it doesn't, and that's fine.  Blah blah blah. You're a trite, delusional idiot.  
heil hitler!

So sexually active people are children but incels are intellectuals? How does that work? 
Am woman, can absolutely tell when someone thinks poorly of women, that is 100% correct. Guys that think you're hiding it... you're not.
I'm curious how did you get that from what I said? I'm saying everyone has standards and if you aren't up to the standards of the women you want you may have to bring your standards down to a more reasonable level is all. If you feel you need no standards based on yourself to be at a reasonable level I can't comment there that's a decision you need to make for yourself. 
If they consider that guy and those like him a saint then the world won't miss them and will be better off without them. 
Yea probably something to do with the prorape and attempts to justify sexual abuse of underage kids... Just saying... 
"Don't allow sane people with common sense" fixed that for ya 
I mean you aren't wrong... 
[removed]
Why? 
You are trying to understand normal human interactions and the first example that you immediately come up with is Ted Bundy. God damn, dude.
hahaha im sure you will. hows that gonna happen?
REEEEEEE rape all femoids
incels.org - you can't ban us there you normie fucking losers,
so sexist normies are sane people?
and why do you imply people who are virgins arent sane
i dont understand , can you explain what asshole thing i did ?
i dont have incel mind set i just happen to be involuntary celibate and dont be an asshole yourself
Famous last words.
http://whois.domaintools.com/incels.org  Seriously?  GoDaddy and CloudFlare are horrible choices if you value free speech. 
Incels make some good points sometimes but this is the kind of insanity that discredits everything.  If you've lived in the real world you'd know that women are capable of conversation and intelligent thought. Are you gonna ignore the fact that a large percentage of them attend universities and obtain degrees?  The reason she ignores you is because she has no interest in you. And it's not about "game" or because you used a 3 word greeting instead of a 5 word greeting. She's not just not attracted to you.
Isn't it more like this?  http://pvcchurch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Puritans.jpg 
Ironically fucked
Oh God, you're right.
Except it's exactly the opposite. I have friends with girlfriends and they agree with me. No, I don't mean they just passively agree with me; I mean we can discuss this stuff for *hours*.   &gt;Are you gonna ignore the fact that a large percentage of them attend universities and obtain degrees?  If you talk to males and females in the real world, you discover that girls manipulate guys into doing all their school work for them and essentially cheat their way to degrees.   &gt;The reason she ignores you is because she has no interest in you. And it's not about "game" or because you used a 3 word greeting instead of a 5 word greeting. She's not just not attracted to you.  That was exactly the fucking point. We get bombarded with garbage about how we "need to learn how to have good conversations with women," need to learn how to write an interesting and engaging opening message on dating websites, etc., and what I posted is how it *really* works.   If she is attracted to you, you don't need to be interesting or funny because she will pretend to find you both. That's why two of the hallmarks of "flirting" are "laughs at your unfunny jokes" and "is interested in the boring stuff you have to say." If she isn't attracted to you, it doesn't matter how interesting or funny you are, you aren't getting laid.  Incels exist because - get this - some guys aren't physically attractive.  
Women also believe in psychics and astrology. I realize you're a woman, but chew on that one for a minute. 
Maybe try not hitting on 14 year olds?  My friends and I talk about politics, art, music, travel, our relationships with our partners and/or our other friends (and yes, our children and/or dogs), our volunteer work, our careers.  We don't just talk about emojis and clothes.  
I'm not trying to understand. I already do. I'm trying to explain to he and others why it's ridiculous to claim that women are mind readers. 
Your either autistic to the point of comedy or an amazing troll.
No, rapists are.
Stop being a pussy?
Alternative explanation: I actually am a visionary.
yes 
Wow, look, the same rehearsed list of "subjects" that everybody else on the internet regurgitates. Reality is, you're a lying dweeb.  You want to know the first clue? "Art." You do not talk about "art," you babbling idiot. NOBODY talks about art. That is not a real thing in life. Yet it comes up in lists time and again in clichéd responses from internet dipshits whenever a vague list of "interests" is necessary.   People do not function as a targeted advertising survey. 
Um, 2 of my friends are fairly successful artists and one is a curator at a museum so yes we talk about art.
And you walk around sipping wine looking out an upper floor of an apartment building, amirite?   This is not a thing. Life is not a movie. 
Have you considered that people misreading exceptionally charismatic people like Ted Bundy doesn't mean they can't pick up in general cues and behaviours from most people?  
Have you considered that you're just pulling the idea of Bundy being "exceptionally charismatic" out of your ass? It's just a catchall to explain away every single scumbag who gets laid. Circular reasoning.  "You're a scumbag, which is why you can't get laid. It has nothing to do with your looks."    What about scumbag A? He gets laid. "Because he's charismatic."   What about scumbag B? He gets laid. "Because he's charismatic."    How do we know? "Oh, because if you get laid and you're a scumbag, that means you must be charismatic."   
First floor actually.  With a patio overlooking nothing interesting.  It’s not my fault your experiences aren’t mine.  We go to periodic art events that my friend gets us tickets to and every month our city has an art walk with free open galleries that we attend.
No I'm not, do you know anything about the guy? He was renowned for being ridiculously charismatic, even in the courtroom he showed that off. A huge amount of famous American serial killers are known for being charismatic, and used it to get out of trouble or to lure victims in a fair bit, and Ted Bundy is considered to be one of the more extreme examples of that.  I don't get why you're using him as an example anyway, he wasn't exactly the model child for healthy interpersonal relationships. It's like using Ian Brady and Myra Hindley as proof that severely mentally ill people are positive influences on each other in relationships.  Edit: also, ignoring hybristophiles, Bundy is only known as having been with two women, and only once he got to university 
nah fam, that a colorized photo of the great norman invasion of incelandia in the fall of ‘17.  those treasures they took were our memes.

Column a. Got it.
Renowned by whom? Women who wanted to fuck him because he was handsome?  
[removed]
No, by the media, interviewers, general public, people who actually met him before he was arrested, a bunch of people.  This isn't some big secret, the guy lied constantly and repeatedly convinced people what he was saying was true.   You're doing your absolute best to support your narrative by flat out denying the reality of the world. Are you going to deny Charles Manson was charismatic next?
Lmao. Nah you rejecting a girl is the exact same thing as the inverse.  It's just less common. How delusional are y'all lol

Not working on your personality or your looks...or success. Things everyone should be doing   Id call that lazy

hey look dude chill, i understand our reputation in reddit , but i am ugly as sin no matter what i do i dont get a gf even fat ugly girls rejects me , i habe maybe 1000 results as a rejection count
And apparently they had a rapist in the making over there too nothing of value was lost when Incels got banned they were cancer.
Autism lol. /is This normie humor?
Wah allow me to insult people or else you’re a pansy.
 if you an attractive girl went “insane” I’m certainly curious about how you would be if you weren’t someone with looks privilege?    Positive things about me.   Old people love me I’m smart Make others more attractive by comparison.  Confidence in my personality. 
That sub is cancer.

&gt;Stalinist.  
What stops you from trying to find some way to be happy?
?
Normies can't comprehend (or refuse to) that an ugly, short man could agree with feminism and still not get laid.  This is from the same people who say:  &gt;And yes, it is absolutely harder if you're not Sexy Chad with the rock-hard abs  The dissonance is amazing
Even on top of that most of the people there are trying to help incels better their lives and change their perspectives. One of the top posts is a guy trying to get a 14 year old kid away from the horrible toxic attitudes that will ruin your life.
Because teaching people how to safely have anal sex is a bad thing? Am I missing something?
[removed]
Did...did the incel just call someone sexist? The hypocrisy is so strong I'm choking on it
Simply found it funny.  
Yes, you are missing intellect.  In a civilized culture, universities teach more important things.  And those interested in anal sex can figure that out on their own. 
i am involantary celibate and feminist at the same time , what are you trying to get at ? 
Slightly unrelated, but Harvard pisses me off in general to no end. They have a 38 billion dollar endowment and are almost exclusively reserved for the wealthiest, most privileged sections of American society. And then they turn around and have the *audacity* to present themselves as this very tolerant, progressive institution concerned with social health and moral integrity.  Disgusting.
Cuck
Reserved?  I went to another well endowed Ivy League cesspool.  I hate these places, but anyone with some intelligence who wants to waste 4 years of his life can get in. 
I meant that they generally admit people who went to prestigious private schools and have well-connected parents. Obviously not *everyone* there is like that, but most of them for sure.
If you have to hope they haven't killed themselves over a subreddit then that is why I imply their not sane, because sane people won't kill themselves over a subreddit. It has nothing to do with virginity that's just your bias twisting what I said... How do I need to explain this, are you mentally handicapped by any chance? 
kek
&gt; even at that shit hole I had some philosophical 3am convos over brew.  Maybe that's what it sounded like to you in your drunken state but it was [more like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpJW6lFUA_g)
that subreddit was their whole life , that was the last thing they had comunauty where they werent opressed
Which has nothing to do with how good or bad a game is.
It's not predatory when it's consensual, li'l buddy.
OP thinks that people who talk about art are strictly caricatures for movies and TV. Talk about lacking in life experience... What a great thread. Lmfao
100% of male white knight SJWs are sexual predators, kid. It's basic psychology. The male mind is not conducive to exaggerated "empathy" towards non-child/animal females. The male mind is one of unrestrained sexual desire towards those it sexually desires.  Those men who identify as feminists and worship women in delusional ways (such as pretending they are anywhere close to being intellectually or morally equal to men) are one of two things:  1. Men who are playing along to try to get in women's pants. 2. Men who are doing/have done heinous things towards women, and are trying to divert attention from this.   Louis CK is the latest blue pilled cuck to be officially outed. You're not fooling me, dude. 
Maybe he lives in some rural place where there are no museums and galleries?  Or in the middle of the frozen tundra or something?
This is so true!
&gt;You state an unreliable analysis of your own looks  You're right. I'm actually super fuckin sexy as hell. I'm like Leonardo DiCaprio in his 20s. I have to fight em off with a stick. That's why I'm here on Reddit.  &gt;then state that you have had relationships with the opposite sex.  Yeah, like almost every adult human being in the world has.  &gt;Impressive. I'm glad you picked up on the heavy sarcasm.  So you're acknowledging that you think women are stupid and simple. You think that might have something to do with why they don't want to go out with you?  &gt;Could they really tell what their physical abusers thought of them?  People are complicated, man. A physically abusive partner can very much love the woman he's abusing. That doesn't make what he does okay, but it does explain why a woman might not have alarm bells going off in her head when she first meets him. That guy isn't sitting across the table on the first date thinking, "I can't wait to beat the shit out of this woman." He almost certainly doesn't plan to hit women at all.  &gt;I take it you haven't seen the females on dating websites insisting that they want a well thought out message...not to just say "hey" or "what's up?"  They're called "women," and yeah, I've seen that. A dating website is a slightly different social context than a bar or a real-life gathering. I often assume that most people actually go out into the world and interact with other human beings to try and make friends and meet romantic partners, but that assumption is clearly wrong in this case.  On a dating website, when she says she wants a well thought out message, she is STILL not asking you to send her a 65-page treatise on your personal hobbies and interests. She's saying, "Tell me about yourself and what you're like and what you think we have in common and why you think I might like you." And if you think those are the same things, you've got a problem.  &gt;Females do not make good conversationalists with males.  Only if every woman you know is an idiot and every man you know is an ass. Which I'm starting to sense is probably true, but, as I said before, that's your fault.  &gt;Also, saying nothing is not the same as telling someone to "get lost."  In online dating? Yes, it absolutely is the same as telling someone to get lost. She's not coming out and saying it because she knows that what will probably come next is a barrage of abuse from you, so she's hoping if she just ignores you, you'll go away.  &gt;This is only true if she finds you attractive. For us, this is false. She will always want us to get lost.  If you have reached the age of 25 and never gotten laid or had a romantic relationship, it is not because you are physically unattractive. Ironclad guarantee. That is not possible.  &gt;Do you really think a condescending message like this is the way to go about changing our minds?  Do I really think you have any interest in listening to anyone who doesn't agree with you?  &gt;You seem to think that male looks are about going to the gym. Have you heard of this thing called, "face?"  You heard of growing a beard? They're all the rage right now and they work wonders for a bad face. Also you could see a dermatologist.  &gt;I would have to put in the plastic surgery, and even then, it wouldn't be enough.  No you wouldn't, and yes it would.  &gt;You're guessing this based on absolutely nothing.  It's based on having known and encountered a whole lot of people like you.  &gt;I could have been talking about something she liked.  How would you have known what she liked? You never asked her what her interests were.  &gt;Women do not converse with even Chad. Look at the second conversation. You see how she's no more talkative in the second conversation? This is the extent to which all of Chad's conversations go with her.  Yeah, I saw how she behaved in the conversation you made up. I happen to know a few men you would refer to as "Chad." I've also seen them interact with their girlfriends and wives. There's a whole lot of conversing. Because, again, there actually are quality human beings out there in the world. The fact that you haven't met any of them is your fault.  &gt;The only difference is she is excited to hear from him and wants to get to the hanging out/sex.  Yep, again, attractive people have better luck getting no-strings hookups and casual dating. Those are the breaks.  &gt;This is laughable. You're trying to insert intelligent meanings into the empty messages of airheads.  No, I'm just telling you what women have told me about how they respond to people like you. Because--I want to emphasize this--I have actual friends who are women, and they have actual conversations with me.  &gt;Her comment means, "what's all this smart person stuff? I just want to put on my nail polish and watch Real Housewives."  How can you be this much of a dick? You're actually more horrible than Roosh V and Paul Elam, in some ways.  &gt;How are you supposed to put in effort when she's not interested in talking to you?  Sometimes, she really just isn't interested in talking to you from the get-go. But most of the time, she's not interested in talking to the person you have turned out to be: a schlubby dude whose opening gambit was filibustering about his personal hobbies and then demanding a date.  &gt;Blah blah blah. You're a trite, delusional idiot.  Maybe. But if I am, I'm a trite, delusional idiot who gets to fuck. And you don't. So maybe you might want to take my advice. Otherwise, enjoy your 100% voluntary celibacy that you could absolutely put an end to if you chose.
So do plenty of men. You're not really thinking this through.
I didn't say women are mind readers. I said that most people can tell when someone thinks little of them.
Yeah dude. Being charismatic does mean people are more likely to enjoy your company. That is kind of what charisma is about.
"Any person that has ever had a single beer after work was really just a shit faced alcoholic LOL"  Boy you're smart.  Every bar I go to I see barbacks just slamming shot after shot, you totally caught me.
It’s not zero personality. For some people physical attraction is a higher percentage.  That’s true. But personality is not zero. 
Yeah, that's a first step, but you've gotta do way more than that. What do you wear when you go hit the bar? Do you keep your facial hair trimmed? What's your haircut situation? You keeping your skin relatively unblemished?  Moving on from physical stuff: You need to approach the conversation basically the same as you would a conversation with anyone else you were trying to get to know. You have to actually WANT TO GET TO KNOW HER. And that means not just talking about you and what you like and what you think.
I’m a mix between cerebrotonic and sloth
Breitbart is malicious at worst, spam at best
Oh, your life must be so unpleasant. You're surrounded by idiot women and sexual predator men. Truly, we are all sufferers from history, but the incel is a double sufferer, since he is afflicted not only by the real world, with the rest of us, but by his fantasies as well.
Wait a minute. You CHOOSE to be INVOLUNTARILY celibate? Do you know how words work?
A stunning riposte.
&gt;we are that short virgin kid who got bullied in highschool and dont leave his house  Sounds like the profile of a mass shooter to me. Get thee to a therapist!
Of course it's harder! But it's not impossible! Again, I am not Sexy Chad, but I still fuck.
I'm enjoying this love-fest between an anarchist and an authoritarian fascist. Misogyny really does bring people together.
[removed]
Only one of those is possible.
I'm not a misogynist and I don't really care what fschmidt's political beliefs are as long as he's not annoying about it.
Honestly, I would hate them a little less if they didn't lie all the time.
Guys i dont think he belongs here¿¿¿¿ he seems severely retarded i doubt he even wants to lose his virginity??????
It must blow the minds of the narrow-minded conformists of modern culture that people with different views can get along. 
Lacking a sense of humour. Typical reddit "normie".
If the narrative ends, than how would the Chad-Bourgeois keep all the sex to themselves? The sexual proletariat would rise up and end hypergamy. You can't control slaves if they know they're slaves, but if you train them to radically insist they wear chains of freedom it's much easier.
You call others "fascist" and yet support sexual capitalism. LOL
He's right to a certain extent - we do agree on one thing, the reality of the blackpill. All other worldviews we have in addition to that are just competing methods for society to adapt to reality.
...that's exactly it. We're pointing out that women will fuck as many Chads as they can, to the exclusion of everyone else. This results in the Chad-Bourgeois hogging all sex to themselves, which long term is a bad situation for pretty much everyone except 8+ men and 5+ women.  No woman would ever love an incel, no matter how much women claim otherwise as they lay in bed with their Tinder chad or 6/10 betabux LTR and surf reddit.  Normies get more blackpilled everyday.
&gt;Second, I'd like you to get an account on OKCupid. It's free.  Oh boy. Well you just walked into [this one.](https://imgur.com/a/QJqqW)
&gt;You're right. I'm actually super fuckin sexy as hell. I'm like Leonardo DiCaprio in his 20s. I have to fight em off with a stick. That's why I'm here on Reddit.  This hyperbolic sarcasm does absolutely nothing for your argument. You are not incel simply because you are not ugly. You deserve to be for being such an obnoxious prick, but alas, life and sex aren't fair.  &gt;Yeah, like almost every adult human being in the world has.  Almost every? 14% of men surveyed are virgins at age 26, and that number would probably rise to about 25% if having sex with prostitutes didn't count.   The majority do, because the majority are physically attractive enough. We aren't.   &gt;So you're acknowledging that you think women are stupid and simple. You think that might have something to do with why they don't want to go out with you?  1. Do you understand this thing called "chronology?" Do you think I was born thinking women are stupid? Or do you think I learned this after actually interacting with them?   2. Yeah, that's it. I go around telling women that I think they're stupid. Oh wait, I don't need to, because they're mind-readers...except when it comes to all these scumbags who have no trouble getting laid, be they mass murderers, rapists, or merely some frat douche who shares nudes of girls he slept with with everyone. Coincidentally, every single one of these assholes are somehow "charismatic." What are the odds? Douchebag LAHWF from YouTube picks up all these chicks, and he's like, heh heh heh heh, Beavis...so charismatic and shit.  &gt;People are complicated, man. A physically abusive partner can very much love the woman he's abusing. That doesn't make what he does okay, but it does explain why a woman might not have alarm bells going off in her head when she first meets him. That guy isn't sitting across the table on the first date thinking, "I can't wait to beat the shit out of this woman." He almost certainly doesn't plan to hit women at all.  How convenient. Women can read our minds and see what we think of them, but these guys who will beat their skull in with a pipe...those guys still totally respect them and everything, so they can't tell.  &gt;They're called "women," and yeah, I've seen that. A dating website is a slightly different social context than a bar or a real-life gathering. I often assume that most people actually go out into the world and interact with other human beings to try and make friends and meet romantic partners, but that assumption is clearly wrong in this case.  Not when they're under the age of 18 they're not. Then they're, "girls." Girls and women are both stupid, boring, and only care about looks (the latter fact is the same for men). Hence, I am talking about *females* here.  Your assumption is wrong in most cases. Most people are smart phone zombies. It's been that way for several years now. You want to talk to a female in person in The Current Year, you're going to have to get her to put her phone down first.  &gt;On a dating website, when she says she wants a well thought out message, she is STILL not asking you to send her a 65-page treatise on your personal hobbies and interests. She's saying, "Tell me about yourself and what you're like and what you think we have in common and why you think I might like you." And if you think those are the same things, you've got a problem.  Hence, "several sentences of substance." I didn't say this hypothetical incel wrote her a dissertation.   &gt;Only if every woman you know is an idiot and every man you know is an ass. Which I'm starting to sense is probably true, but, as I said before, that's your fault.  No. I've met my share of assholes and I've met my share of non-assholes. Coincidentally, many of the non-assholes are also incels, like me, while NONE of the assholes are.   &gt;In online dating? Yes, it absolutely is the same as telling someone to get lost. She's not coming out and saying it because she knows that what will probably come next is a barrage of abuse from you, so she's hoping if she just ignores you, you'll go away.  There's always an excuse for women's despicable claims and behavior.   "A guy asked me out in a public place. #MeToo" "So what?" "It's inappropriate. I didn't want to make a scene and reject him in front of everyone."  "A guy asked me out in a private place. #MeToo" "So what?" "It's inappropriate. It made me feel uncomfortable because he could have raped me and there would be no one around to stop him."  And now it's, "she was afraid of a barrage of abuse!" No, it's that she has no guts and expects the world to bend to her every whim.  &gt;If you have reached the age of 25 and never gotten laid or had a romantic relationship, it is not because you are physically unattractive. Ironclad guarantee. That is not possible.  Yeah, Joseph Merrick (Google him) was not incel because he was physically unattractive.   You're not even delusional at this point, you're just outright lying.  &gt;Do I really think you have any interest in listening to anyone who doesn't agree with you?  That's exactly what you stated your purpose was: To convince someone to agree with you.  &gt;You heard of growing a beard? They're all the rage right now and they work wonders for a bad face. Also you could see a dermatologist.  You heard of not being ABLE to grow a beard? Because some of us fall under this category.   Also, what does a dermatologist have to do with bad bone structure? They are mostly useless even for treating acne, which is the only applicability they have in the case of "face."  &gt;No you wouldn't, and yes it would.  You are actually suggesting that face doesn't matter. Insane.  &gt;It's based on having known and encountered a whole lot of people like you.  And now generalizations are perfectly acceptable. No hypocrisy here or anything.  &gt;How would you have known what she liked? You never asked her what her interests were.  Because maybe this hypothetical incel either actually read her dating profile or had another brief conversation with her before she decided to ghost him (since a more physically attractive offer became available).  &gt;Yeah, I saw how she behaved in the conversation you made up. I happen to know a few men you would refer to as "Chad." I've also seen them interact with their girlfriends and wives. There's a whole lot of conversing. Because, again, there actually are quality human beings out there in the world. The fact that you haven't met any of them is your fault.  You are using the term "conversing" extremely loosely. If you mean that she bitches at him about what to buy at the supermarket, then sure. If you mean that they have intelligent conversations, uh, no.  You can't fool me. I have actually lived in the real world.   &gt;Yep, again, attractive people have better luck getting no-strings hookups and casual dating. Those are the breaks.  And unattractive people won't get those things without being used for their resources. That's not what we want. We can't get what we want, and that's fine with some of us in and of itself. It's the fact that we are being lied to and insulted based on these lies as the paradigm that is pissing us off.   &gt;No, I'm just telling you what women have told me about how they respond to people like you. Because--I want to emphasize this--I have actual friends who are women, and they have actual conversations with me.  You're paraphrasing what they told you and putting it into more intelligent English, which is the first thing you're doing wrong. The second mistake you are making is believing a word that comes out of a woman's mouth. Lying is like breathing to women.  
Here's the thing. A really attractive person with zero/or a bad personality could score the same as a average/above average person that connects really well with the girl.   Personality does matter, but it's relative. 
&gt; Nope. Didn't happen.  This happens all the time. You are coping.  Though, I agree that personality matters, but it's relative to the person that possesses it. 
Isn't he like the father of incel? I thought he came first and coined all the terms and shit 
You are incorrect.  Personality matters.  A lot. 
Reminder:  Just asserting something doesn't make it true.  If you want the truth, start a debate thread on this subject. 
WTF DELETE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's for beta orbiters who think they have a shot because "good personality". Fucking lol at how halo effect is still intact.
I thought that you posted this in response to the lookists.  Personality does matter, as she says, but which personality is attractive depends on the culture.  In feminist cultures, moronic assholes are attractive.  In civilized patriarchal cultures, decent men are attractive. 
lol.  normie.  used unironically.  you're going places (but not the inside of a girls pants lmao)
Dude, remember like 5 days ago when you were "reformed?" 
lol at the downvotes, landwhales really don't know how to use Reddit.  You're spot on. Only thing I'd add to that is when people say personality matter, they mean who would they choose between a 8/10 guy with a good and bad personality. That never means they'd choose an ugly guy with that desired personality.    Some women do have tendency to go after bad guys but lookism still applies, because they'd never go for ugly bad guys. Those bad guys that are popular with ladies and fuck new pussy every weak are all chads. [Here's](https://youtu.be/p8ePDKlF6T0) Jordan Peterson explaining how it works.  
That's a really awkward, leading question. For lack of a better way to put it, normies and cels are a different species. Things that normies talk about work. For normies. Cels are distressed, often angry. Broken. They're so accustomed to being the victim that it becomes the default. There's a lot of cognitive dissonance, too. Most cels that I've spoken to think that they're both more intelligent than everyone and worthless. Narcissism with a side of inferiority complex. That makes interaction difficult.   Don't get me wrong, normies are plenty fucked up. Some have the same problems as cels, some have different problems, but everybody is fucked up in some way. Some normies hate cels. Some cels hate normies. It's this twisted symbiosis that could bear fruit if not for the shared animosity. The only difference between cels and normies is virginity. For some, that's a big difference.   Certain, entirely subjective, things get spoken about as object fact by cels. To the normie, that just screams lack of 7understanding. Certain opinions shared normies cause cels to deem normies mentally deficient. It's like it's either incel or retard. There's way too many things that are not black and white. The primary difference lies in how we deal with our issues. Both sides could learn something from the other. Commence with the insults. I'm sure I'm an idiot. Good luck 
I would define lookism as the belief that only looks matter, and this is obviously wrong.  There is a whole list of factors that include looks and personality.  And on top of that, looks and personality can't really be separated since personality affects looks.  Obviously someone who is very ugly or has a very unattractive personality will fail.  But in my experience most incels aren't that ugly.  They just have personalities that repulse the degenerate sluts of modern culture.  Jordan Peterson is one of the brightest normies, but he is still part of modern culture.  If you really want to understand the truth, read these:  http://www.happierabroad.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=20929  http://caamib.wordpress.com/the-story-of-your-incel-an-inconvenient-truth/  http://www.mikraite.org/Human-Evolution-tp17.html 
I doubt he even knows what that means???????
I disagree, I think lookism is belief that looks matter above all else. That no bad personality can eliminate your ability to get laid or be in a relationship if you have good looks.   Yes, looks effect your personality quite heavily. That's part of the reason people fail to acknowledge the flaws in attractive people, compared to the ugly ones.    Here's how girls react when they're being checked out  By attractive guy - instant self-esteem boost, increased activity in neurotransmitter dopamine resulting in elevated pleasure, often reward this action by smiling back.  By ugly guy - Creep, is assumed a rapist or a pedophile, defense mechanism kicks in, often respond with disgusted look on their face.
incel.org, come home incel man the promised land awaits
Then I just disagree with you.  It's fairly pointless to argue about all this.  People believe in all kinds of garbage, lookism included.  The main reason that people believe in lookism is to give themselves an excuse to do nothing, and there is nothing that modern people like more than doing nothing.  There are solutions to incel.  Most incels would rather complain than solve anything.  That's fine, good riddance to their genes.  But I want to make the options known for those interested in solutions. 
Teaching people about safe sex so that they don’t have to get kids seems pragmatic. You know they’ll have sex either way. 
I wouldn't worry too much about people having kids from anal sex. 
Talking about sex in general. STDs do happen. 
find girlfriends abroad = girlfriend wants money or citizenship   That doesn't mean they're attractive.            Also, would your wife really tell you directly if you were unattractive?
&gt; find girlfriends abroad = girlfriend wants money or citizenship  I recently made a post on this topic.  Why don't you post there?  https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/7bv5pv/dont_believe_the_lies_about_foreign_brides/  &gt; Also, would your wife really tell you directly if you were unattractive?  What does this have to do with my previous comment? 
If they have kids, that is society's problem.  If they get STDs, that is their own damn problem.  Why should I care? 
You said/implied you ask your wife to judge your looks. 
No, I said I ask my wife to judge other men's looks. 
You shouldn’t but if you don’t why post this?  “I’m dissatisfied with x” “I don’t care about x”
HE'S PULLING STUFF OUT OF HIS ASS? NIGGA LOOK AT YOUR OWN DAMN POST! Shit dude, you're a sad creature that finished agriculture school and lives off of their parents allowance, and holy shit have I never seen this amount of pseudo-psychology in my life. At least you're breaking records... Look, it might be hard to accept, but not all of us understand psychology, I'm in Physics and Engineering, and I suck at anything related to humans, but hell if I can't say bullshit when I see it...
They weren't even our posts.   A lot of them were from other parts of social media (Facebook, Twitter) or from their sock puppet accounts.
Not the same "x".  I am dissatisfied with modern education.  I don't care about anal sex. 
Oh ok. I don’t like the Prussian school-system
The post says that these brides are mail-order and admits that it's pure business.   They're basically live-in escorts. They don't actually desire us.
Did you read past the first paragraph? 
&gt; I'm not trying to understand. I already do.  I emphatically disagree.
Of course, all he claimed was a lower divorce rate after the first paragraph. Still doesn't mean there's actual desire.   Same way you don't actually have to love your job to stay employed. 
Ah, so you have lots of control over who views and reports don't ya. 
[removed]
The divorce rate is by far the best objective indicator that I am right.  If the woman really had no desire, then she could just divorce and find another husband. 
Not even close, but nice try. 
Way to ignore his point, you creepy male feminist. Know who else was a "male feminist"? Ted Bundy.  Stay away from high schools you sick fuck.
Ted Bundy called himself a "feminist"(seriously look it up...he handed out rape prevention pamphlets and everything) and we all knew how that turned out for his victims.
Tell that to Ted Bundy's victims.
How is he incorrect if we have proven it so many times with tinder experiments?
You forgot the only solution as an ugly man: The rope.
Because Tinder is not real life.  It is a tool that can lead to real hookups and real relationships, but your face only gets you in the door.  It does not seal the deal.
Thats interesting, because many incels do seem to "seal the deal" in these experiments with the Chad faces they possess.  Yet you idiots claim it's their "terrible" personality.  Oops.  
If they truly sealed the deal, they would not be incels.  Furthermore, why do you believe these experiments and their results even happened? Also, when I did a brief stint on OKCupid, if a guy was too ridiculously handsome, I generally wrote him off as a probable hoax.
&gt; If they truly sealed the deal, they would not be incels.  You'e not paying attention, or you're painfully slow. Incels seal the deal in **tinder experiments**. They regularly convince women  to hand out a number and accept offers of sex(and sometimes, even get propositioned themselves). The caveat here is that they can only do this when **using another man's face, one that is good looking**. So what this tells us is that people like you are full of shit, and it really is all about looks.  Pay attention next time. Like talking to a brick wall here.
Which of my 3 solutions wouldn't work for you?
-Prostitute: Illegal in my country, and even if it wasn't, I'm not giving a dime of my money to a female.  - Dating Abroad in non feminist country: First off, which countries are "non feminist", secondly, why do you pay no importance to looks?  - Religion for socializing: I agree with this one. But it does nothing to help my inceldom.
You're severely overestimating our looks. Your solutions would work for many normies who just didn't have good luck. If you knew how hideous some of us looked, you wouldn't be so sure of your solutions working.   All ideologies aside - if you're ugly, you're fucked (not literally). That's the whole story. You can build a web of ideologies around it and women can keep denying it but their actions will always make everything clear.
Female talking about art:  "Oh, cool!"  "Ewww, creepy!"  Females' "interests" are just part of their fake presentation. If you tried talking to a female about anything she is "interested" in, even if you were Chad, she would want to change the subject. Their breadth of knowledge about any topic other than the garbage I laid out is tissue paper thin. They try to memorize the bold words in the text. 
Again if you have to hope they don't kill themselves over a subreddit then they're clearly not sane. Attempt to justify it all you want that fact isn't changing. 
Seems like I hit a nerve.
If you define "hitting a nerve" as "I said something on reddit that a person typed a reply to" then sure, you hit a nerve buddy :)
What Chad pic was used?
An incel is some one who can't get laid and then turns into a whiny little bitch. 
[removed]
I've had plenty of guys reject me and I've never called any of them "pigs". I don't get salty like that, I just move on.
This kind of bullshit stereotyping is why people fucking hate you lot. 
All women lie all the time? 
correct
[removed]
See, this is why people regard incels as a hate group. 
[removed]
I love how you latched onto this comment but completely ignored everything I said in my earlier comment
“Chad” and “Stacy” aren’t real things. You talk about coping... catagorizing women and men into these little boxes as a way to explain why you don’t have a girlfriend is coping. And I’m never going to change your mind. But as I mentioned in my longer comment, not every woman behaves this way. If that is the way you are, fine. But the vast majority of women that I know have had less than five sexual partners and hardly spent their adolescence/20s trying to fuck as many chads as possible. I know it’s difficult for you to wrap your head around, but most of the women I know were too busy with under grad, graduate school, and careers that they earned to spend their time seeking out chads to fuck.
So do men? I've met a number. So I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. There are stupid people on all sides. 
Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better...
I know you think it’s impossible because you think any girl at any time can go up to a guy and boom it happens, but I’ve asked plenty of guys out and been rejected. And I know a super hot guy who frequently gets turned down. And you know what, like normal people who know that this is the way dating works, we all move on
Would you be so kind as to outline those reasons? 
* Females think lesser of incels * Females treat incels like shit * Females impose double standards on incels * Females don't have sex with incels
It is possible to care about the problem of rape and suicide st the same time. It is not an either or situation. I for example think it’s disgusting that women get raped. I also felt awful when someone I went to school with committed suicide, and wished that he had received the help he needed. The ability to have compassion does not come from a finite bucket of resources. That is what being compassionate is. 
Can you explain to me why they should have sex with you? 
[removed]
I am well within my right to hate them for not having sex with me and having sex with others.
And why should they have sex with someone who hates them? 
Well it seems like they already do. I would say a Chad who pump, dumps and throws them out after hates them.  Chad is the ultimate conundrum, he breaks all the rules
Are you referring to those videos where the guy asks a girl on a date, and then verbally abuses her as soon as he turns up? I would wager that it's the aggression that makes it all go south. Plus the fact that she's been lied to. 
[removed]
I really don't think most men are like that. That point aside though, what would you do if you had the opportunity to become intimate with a woman? 
The point is that they do have sex with men like that so your point about females not having sex with men that hate them is moot.  If I had the opportunity to have sex with a female I would be happy but I don't because I am ugly and females only like a certain type.
Why should they have sex with you though? You've already said you hate them. I would not have sex with a woman who hates me. I doubt many women would either, so I don't think my point is irrelevant, I think you're wrong. I think that women don't have sex with you because you are hateful. 
No, they don't have sex with me cause I am ugly. They would have sex with Chad no matter how hateful he is.
How do you know that?
because I have been called ugly, get no matches on Tinder and get single digit percentages on photofeeler
No, why do you think that they would have sex with a "Chad" if he hated them? Why do you think all women would act the same way in any given circumstance? Why do you think they should have sex with you?
Tinder experiments have been done with a hateful chad.  They should have sex with me cause it would be a nice thing to do.
If it's the Tinder experiments I've seen, it's been where a woman has been scared off by a hostile and aggressive person. Why should someone have sex with you to be nice if you hate them?
They let Chad do whatever he wants.  It would be a nice thing to do because me not having sex is make no me depressed and having sex would alleviate that somewhat.

When it comes to casual hookups, personality does matter but just not as much as we're told it does. Personality will help much more if you go for your looksmatch or below. If you try running game on a 7.5/10 when you're a 4/10 then it's very likely you're going to fail miserably no matter how good your game is. If you're a chad at a nightclub, a horny 7/10 girl will be way more likely to pinch your ass signalling that she wants your attention, meaning she wants your dick inside her that same night. 
Much like incels.

yooo my bro its been a while ,  i got banned from r/incels so they got banned in return xd
Tl;dr
That one extreme example *does* outweigh all of my lived experience. How about "the vast majority of the time except sometimes with psychopaths who are very good at adopting personality traits to get what they want, which in this case is violence against women"?
Yes, it is like talking to a brick wall trying to explain to a dumbass incel that you have have more than a handsome face to get a girlfriend and/or get laid.  Elliot Roger for example was a good looking kid.  Wealthy too.  Unfortunately he was also a psychopath.
Thank you for this post. Guys, calling women "females" is a pretty reliable flag that there are issues, and we know that. I'd respond more but I just learned that as a woman I am a poor conversationalist. 
YOUR "I'M UGLY" COMPARISON WAS WITH THE ELEPHANT MAN and you think *women* are the ones with personality problems? Dude. 
Did you eat paint chips as a kid?   **When catfishing, incels seal the deal with the handsome face they are using**.  What part of this do you not get?
The part where you (a) believe some video you saw on the internet is fact (b) even if they looked like Chad, it does not compute that if they met in person she would like him enough to want to have sex with him (c) even if the catfishing incidences were fact, the notion that you believe this is a reasonable thing to do to someone.
Let me spell it out for you.  Incels create fake tinder accounts using pictures of handsome men. They receive matches from women, and then set up dates, and offers of sex from women. **They can only do this because of the pics they are using**.   What this means is, if the incels **looked like the guy they are pretending to be, they would have no trouble receiving sex and dates with women. Proving that it is all about looks**.  Does this make sense for your limited mind?
Believe some video? No, stupid, I have done the experiments myself. All I have to do is ask women for their number and if they want to fuck, and 9 times out of 10 the answer is "yes, heres my number, tee hee".  Keep coping. LOOKS.
And what about all the abusive relationships women get into when good looking Chads beat the womans ass? More personality detecting failure? LOL.
Normies are the biggest liars around. It is 100% about how you look. The evidence is overwhelming.
I do not believe you.  I never did Tinder.  I was on OKC.  During my brief stint there, I communicated with maybe 12 guys.  A few were so blatant that all they wanted was sex that I cut off ties immediately because I don’t want STDs.  (A few were very young guys claiming to be virgins - maybe they were incels?) A few had stock photo headshots and canned responses so I guessed them to be hoaxes and stopped writing.  A couple were Good Christian Men looking for Godly Women - no.  So I ended up meeting 4.  2 never got past the first date because they just acted weird or pushy about sex (one was white, one was Native American, both were stocky because I sometimes like the cuddly bear type).  One guy I went on 2 whole dates with but he broke out the drugs on the 2nd date so no (he was Vietnamese, if it matters).  The final guy, half black/half Chinese, I went on 3 dates with.  We had the sex things.  He was pretty cool and we are still FB friends.  But he did not want a relationship and I did not want or need an FWB so gone.  That was the entirety of my experience - 12 contacts, 4 dates, none relationship, one sex.  You need more than looks to seal the deal.  The end.
&gt; it's run by people who are privy to the game and manipulate it.  Exactly.  Normies are just gears in the machine.  Most normies are like rice, they take on the flavor of whatever culture is around them.
Some of us dont want to "date", you hilarious idiot. We simply want sex. You cannot receive casual sex unless you meet a minimum threshold of looks.  If i wanted to be a doormat in a relationship and receive an unenthusiastic handjob twice a month I'd let you know.
Your boring story has nothing to do with what I said.
actually agree with that
Look at my post history.....not an incel. You people are just annoying
It does.  You said looks were all that mattered, and have anecdotal evidence.  I said looks aren’t, and have anecdotal evidence.  
&gt; So go get laid? It's not hard, I've been doing it since I was 12. Newsflash: if I were an autist I wouldn't get nearly as much pussy as I do. A lot of it is to do with your behaviour in social situations. Plus I'm only 5'8" which isn't ideal in the slightest. My face is my saving grace on the physical front.  Uh dude, face is the most important physical aspect.  So congrats on winning the genetic lottery and all, but some of us weren't so fortunate.
You said you fucked some half black half chinese guy. That tells us nothing.  Post his face, and yours, and we will be able to tell if this was a case of the average to goodlooking woman sleeping with an ugly man. Otherwise, everything you said means nothing.
It tells you I found 4 guy’s attractive enough to meet and only 1 had whatever quality to take it further with.  Because LOOKS. AREN’T. ENOUGH! You need to be charming too.  (And also not a druggie.)
And what if all 4 of these guys were average looking while you look like shit? That would just prove you're a typical modern female using hypergamy to her full advantage.
I dont have any musical talent, and Im not above average facially, I'm a confirmed 2/10.  So again, congrats and all, but it is still over for ugly men like me.
This is why you are an incel.  You care more about how you look than developing a decent personality.  Enjoy not having sex.  
Bet Elliot couldn’t get matches probably because of his personality. See it’s like a double barrier. First Ones attractiveness. Let’s say you make it past this barrier only then personality is a problem.(unless you’re attractive enough for this not to matter) if you’re a fucking psychopath with autism obviously no one is going to like you. Personality only matters if you’re less than 10/10 an only in extremes.
&gt;Any questions?  Yes I have a few.  I am 5ft1 - How can I be taller?  I have the body/frame of a child - How do I appear more manly?  My face is 3/10 - How do I become more attractive?  I am a mentalcel and medicine makes me worse - How do I become normal?  What woman would ever date me?  
So you accept #3 and reject #1.  About #2:  &gt; which countries are "non feminist"  Examples include Russia, Ukraine, Philippines, and Mexico.  &gt; why do you pay no importance to looks?  Because I have yet to see a real life example where this prevented solution #2. 
These questions aren't related to my post.  I guess I also have a question.  Where can I find decent cheesecake?  It's been a long time since I have had any. 
It's funny you feel that way about them, seeing as most normal functional people feel that way about you 
Wait you mean women like fucking attractive guys nearly as much as guys like fucking attractive women... Mind blown omg...
Because people get on tinder looking to hookup, and no one goes there looking for ugly people... When looking for a hookup physical traits are everything it's long term shit where personality is factored in. 
Canned robotic response when faced with uncomfortable truths.
The truth being you’re an idiot? Yes.
What if we don't want "long term shit", idiot?
We have all proven that if we looked good we would be receiving sex off tinder no problem. You claim it's my personality, because you don't like what I have to say.  "This is why ur incelllll" is a canned, robotic, defensive response when faced with the uncomfortable truth of you and your world view being shattered.  I am incel due to my face and height. That's it.  
You’re an incel because you are so hung up on your face and height that you never bothered to develop a personality or character or confidence.  That s it.  Lots of short ugly dudes get laid.  Look at Danny Devito.  
The point is personality means fuck all. Of course it sailed right over your head.
I don’t think he meant irl he meant the way media like buzzfeed plasters everywhere on the Internet. 
&gt; Look at Danny Devito.  He's a hollywood actor with fame and money. You're not very good at this, are you?
He is a Hollywood actor because he had talent. And personality .  You think he would have gotten anywhere with just his looks? You’re worse at this than you can possibly think.
Short and ugly? Just become a hollywood actor to fill the short ugly man trope. It's one in a billion, but you can do it!!!11111  What's next, are you going to tell me to become a world class athlete? Politician? Astronaut? Musician?
Why do you post so much porn? Are you an incel in denial?
Yes.  Develop a talent or skill or get an education or travel or earn some money or do some fucking thing that makes you an interesting and more well rounded person.  That is what gets you laid.  Don’t sit around in your room fuming because no girl is knocking down your door trying to get with you.  
I'm not fuming. I have accepted my subhumanity and genetic lottery loss. It's people like you who need to be shut down...willingly and knowingly lying to ugly men and giving them false hope.
So you are a crazy person.  Got it.
It isn’t lying.  Some of you idiots look just fine.  I’ve seen your pics.  You are just trying to drag everyone down into the sewer with you, like an internet Pennywise.  If you go around calling yourself ugly and subhuman, how do you think that translates to your body language?  Nobody wants to date a dour loser.
Truecels dont post their pics. You saw fakecels who wanted validation.  And I dont drag anyone down. If someone escaped, great for them. But I also deal in reality.
So the university shut down all of its other classes for this volunteer only workshop that the students, not the faculty, asked for?
Do you really not understand me or are you playing dumb?   She does not expect love and passion from the marriage in the first place, so she won't divorce to get these things.      She stays in the marriage for his resources, just as people stay in their jobs for paychecks. Only an extremely bad situation would cause either one to leave.
You deal in misery.  You dwell on it.  I’m off to make breakfast for my partner now.  Enjoy inceldom.
You want to get this sub banned too?
Normie hypocrisy never ends...      The Drama and The_Donald subs think that the world owes them everything for being white. They blame minorities for their situations. Some people want to hunt them out, but they still get more respect than we do.      The shoplifting sub is a place for those who feel entitled to a shop's items. They think anything they want is theirs to take for free. They're openly discussing strategies to steal. Nobody wants to hunt them out.       What about the subreddit to watch people die? Others feel comfortable with that?      
We never encouraged rape. The few who did were probably alts from IncelTears...because they have such wonderful lives from being soooo nice to people.      Non-incels also made subs that encourage suicide more than we ever did. They also get annoying normies, but not nearly as many as we do.      We don't call all women worthless. Only the ones who act stupidly. Feminists will also say things about men who behave stupidly.
You're a gigantic idiot of epic proportions. And you are a woman, so having a cuck BF doesnt really impress me. Any woman can get a boyfriend.
And you can’t even get laid! Ha ha! Seriously, I feel bad for men who are simply unfortunate with women.  I don’t feel bad at all for shitheel misogynists.
He made an (ridiculous) absolute statement and I provided a challenge to his absolute statement.  He said, "If you have reached the age of 25 and never gotten laid or had a romantic relationship, it is not because you are physically unattractive. Ironclad guarantee. That is not possible."  You people are *so* predictable and *so* stupid.
Apparently that is mind blowing for people like you, since you and your ilk claim it's our personalities that are the problem. 
Where you fuck up is assuming that the demographic that uses Tinder/OkCupid etc. is reflective of the general population. The type of people that go on those things are generally shallower or super-introverted and more likely to grab on to some good looking guy due to desparation. They are a self-selecting demographic, much like hobby electronics (like Arduino) are a self-selecting demographic of Maker-type and engineer-type people.   People out in public are a different demographic. That being said, you have as much of a chance meeting someone out in public and making a best friend as you do making a relationship with a woman. If you can't hold a good long-term friendship IRL with someone, then that alone is going to greatly impact your ability to hold a romantic relationship.    the ability to have a relationship with a woman is dependend on your ability to hold platonic relationships with people in general. 
Basically *all* women believe in that insanely stupid shit. Almost no men do. 
&gt;stereotyping  You don't seem to know what this word means. 
While that may illustrate your lived experience (?) you are so overpoweringly incorrect it's hard for me to respond. No, all women do not. I do not, in the least. My friends do not. My mom and sister do not, nor do their friends. Guess who does? Some dudes I know, including one who wanted to read my tarot and do the i ching on the same first date.    *There are stupid people of all genders.* No need to paint with so broad a brush, it's not going to do you or anybody any good.
Religious people are hypocrites. They're just better at hiding their indecent behavior.     One of my cousins comes from a more religious family and covers her head. When she comes here, she wears a bikini to the beach and goes clubbing.   My sister doesn't even go clubbing, even though she used to bring lots of men home.
I bet if some crazy "psychic" bitch offered you and your female friends and your female relatives a "free reading," you would all be eager and squealing. 
Yes, the person who thinks it's entirely valid to use the elephant man to compare himself to and then directly insults the person who says "uh that's the elephant man" is unpredictable and full of insight.  I am the stupid one, for sure. Saying his name and then "google it" isn't condescending at all. 
Well, you'd lose that bet. I guess we're done here. 
Many misogynists have no problems sleeping with women. Its all looks, as I said.
I have a solid group of friends because looks arent as important for that.
No. It. Isn’t. You obtuse moron.
Since you used Danny DeVito as your "proof" I'll ask you how Donald Trump has slept with so many women if personality mattered? 
When you make an absolute statement, all it takes is one exception to disprove the claim.   Take a fucking philosophy class, you fucking idiot. 
Money, duh.
It certainly wasn’t his looks (gag).
He looked very good in his prime. Hes 70 now, dumbass. And you cant use money as an excuse and claim it doesnt work for DeVito. As shown, you are logically inconsistent and intellectually dishonest.
No he didn’t.  He was always an obnoxious, abrasive asshole and was gross.  And Devito did not inherit millions from his father (that I am aware of anyway), he earned it by being talented and funny.
&gt; He was always an obnoxious, abrasive asshole   Exactly. Hes the thesis for why personality doesnt matter.
It does matter.  I just said I would never sleep with him because he is gross.  Edit:  well maybe I didn’t spell it out but it was heavily implied.
Thats okay, he has slept with much better looking women than you. I dont think he cares that an obnoxious SJW on reddit would reject him. In fact, it would probably make him howl in laughter.
And how did you meet them?
He has also had dozens of complaints of sexual harassment and a few complaints of rape (one from his own wife) so I don’t really care who he has slept with or what makes him howl in laughter.  An ugly sleazeball who can buy sex should be inspiring to you.  Just go make a bunch of money and all your problems will be solved, right? No, because you will still be a miserable moron moaning on Reddit about how he hates women.
Similar interests
Am I back in CX debate? No, golly, it looks like Reddit. Enjoy feeling aggrieved, I guess. 
Blah blah cope.  Hes an asshole, gets sex. Personality does not matter. Lmfao.
Of those people, how many of them have physically came over to your house more than once to hang out?
Because he BUYS IT you idiot.
And DeVito doesnt?
Things are different when you leave reddit and do field research in the rest of the world. 
[removed]
All of them, so 6. What does this have to do with inceldom?
You’re missing the point.  Devito can buy it because he used his talents and personality to get fame and money.  He didn’t just walk into a movie set one day and be handed a role.  He had to earn it.  Now he has it.  And the sex that comes with it.
He got incredibly lucky to catch a hollywood break. You are so fucking stupid. Please dont have kids, for the love of god.
I already had one.  Unlike you, who probably never will.  I work in politics. She works in legal services.  Neither of us are stupid.  You have that all to yourself.
Working in politics doesnt mean you arent stupid. See Donald. You have done nothing in this exchange but change the goalposts and fail to understand simple snd easy points. I hope for your kids sake you used your dyke partners womb.
Again, it’s because he has money.  And my partner is a man, so.  Edit:  but glad to see you are as homophobic as you are misgynist.  Wanna throw in some racism and go for the trifecta?

I had a friend of the age of 24, who was pretty introverted and kept to himself. He was not a looker in the slightest(I'm male and even I would consider him somewhat ugly). Like a lot of people, he struggled with depression daily (mostly due to his low self-confidence from his family tearing itself apart due to drugs). I visited him at least twice a week to just talk to him and let him talk through his problems. He never once complained about himself being an incel, it never bothered him because I was voluntarily celibate. Sex was never a dominant thought for either of us because we valued trying to be good to other people, doing things for our other mutual friends and such. It was because of his fun-loving personality and his enjoyment of helping out friends that he was able to meet and date 2 average looking women during time in community college. He started going to a professional councillor who also helped him stop hating himself in private to a degree. He'd still have down days where it bordered on suicidal, but he would reach out to his friends those days and we'd hang out and talk.   Also it helps if you reach out to your friends and have them take you to places where you can meet women. My Friend and I (both male) both were casual friends with a few women for a year or two before we got into relationships with different unrelated women.   Even if some woman has no interest in you, it can still be beneficial to you if you try to be a genuine friend to her, as most women know other women who are single. only 25% of women are even ever married anyway by the [age of 25](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-will-everyone-i-know-be-married/). Women who you are good friends with tend to love to try to play matchmaker if they know someone who could potentially be interested in you.
Men and women cant be friends if the man is celibate. Biologically, he will always desire her sexually, as his needs aren't getting met.
&gt; She works in legal services.   At least try and get your story straight next time you crazy loon.
My daughter does.  
Ah, so you're an old woman who doesnt understand the level of hypergamy prevalent in modern times.
Pot kettle, etc
And you are a dumbass kid who thinks it is more prevalent than it is.

Some religious people are hypocrites, and some religions are bad.  But outside of religion, almost everyone is bad.  Anyway, what religion is this cousin? 
This makes no sense.  Under modern Western law, women make more money by repeatedly divorcing and marrying.  The system is designed to financially encourage women to divorce. 
This is just an extreme example of the kind of thing that interests the intellectual elite of modern culture.  It makes no difference who asked for it.  Yes they presumably still have the old classes, but from what I remember, the general quality of education is poor. 
They absolutely can be friends, so long as you practice self-restraint and understand your position in the relationship, just like brother and sister can be friends only and not commit incest. 
And what exactly does that gain you?  That kind of thinking is self-destructive and pitiful.  It's why you are where you are now.  I don't have a whole lot going for me.  Not rich, not hot, kinda boring, am fat.  But I don't creep women out, I groom and wear clean clothes, have enough money to be independent and have fun and plan for a future.  You don't need to be "chad" just be a better you.  
Newsflash: good looking men favored over ugly men.  Well groomed men, men with careers and men who have personalities too.  
Lift weights get a tan get a better haircut make more money.  
I've seen plenty of ugly and even pathetic looking men date and get married.  They weren't sad sacks, they took care of themselves and they made money.  No one has an incentive to give you sex if you are unsuccessful 
You people understand calling us Normie's isn't an insult right?  I've got a steady job, friends, female friends no less, dated several women.  Life doesn't have to be perfect, if you bitch less and live more magically people want to be around you.  I would be one of you if I stopped trying.  
Personality factored in =/= looks factored *out*.   
Except you all bitch about the same things and use terms like Normie and Chad and build your little female archetypes.  It's not hard to generalize you sad sack people. 
Because tinder isn't a dating app it's a lets fuck app.  You're not looking for people to spend time with your looking for someone who will give you a boner/lady boner for about an hour. 
[removed]
You're using the idiom incorrectly. 
I don't think you understand that looks have to be important in a sexual relationship. Sex is a very primitive thing, why would a female want to make with a male who is lacking physical attributes they find desirable?  We are animals in pants, weaker smaller male animals generally don't get to mate.  I'm no prize but I'm a big strong bearded guy with a cool car, interesting stories and some $$$, why would a woman choose a smaller, weaker, uglier, poorer man over me especially if it's just for sex?
Nope. Just good-looking and money. Personality has absolutely zero to do with it. 
I don't understand what you are complaining about.  No one owes you sex.  It doesn't matter if women are attracted to looks or money or personality or any other variable if you lack it too bad so sad you don't get laid. 
Because you guys are one massive circle jerking echo chamber.  If you improve yourself and be the best you you can be it's not hard to find a woman to have sex with and you can get married. They might not be the woman you desire but that's because you probably are very desirable.  Water finds its own level.
