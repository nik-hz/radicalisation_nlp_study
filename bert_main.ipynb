They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued during and after the Civil War until around 1923. The Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to invite these groups to join the government and instead suppressed them with force.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Braincels/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28\n",

      "&gt;You're right. I'm actually super fuckin sexy as hell. I'm like Leonardo DiCaprio in his 20s. I have to fight em off with a stick. That's why I'm here on Reddit.  This hyperbolic sarcasm does absolutely nothing for your argument. You are not incel simply because you are not ugly. You deserve to be for being such an obnoxious prick, but alas, life and sex aren't fair.  &gt;Yeah, like almost every adult human being in the world has.  Almost every? 14% of men surveyed are virgins at age 26, and that number would probably rise to about 25% if having sex with prostitutes didn't count.   The majority do, because the majority are physically attractive enough. We aren't.   &gt;So you're acknowledging that you think women are stupid and simple. You think that might have something to do with why they don't want to go out with you?  1. Do you understand this thing called \"chronology?\" Do you think I was born thinking women are stupid? Or do you think I learned this after actually interacting with them?   2. Yeah, that's it. I go around telling women that I think they're stupid. Oh wait, I don't need to, because they're mind-readers...except when it comes to all these scumbags who have no trouble getting laid, be they mass murderers, rapists, or merely some frat douche who shares nudes of girls he slept with with everyone. Coincidentally, every single one of these assholes are somehow \"charismatic.\" What are the odds? Douchebag LAHWF from YouTube picks up all these chicks, and he's like, heh heh heh heh, Beavis...so charismatic and shit.  &gt;People are complicated, man. A physically abusive partner can very much love the woman he's abusing. That doesn't make what he does okay, but it does explain why a woman might not have alarm bells going off in her head when she first meets him. That guy isn't sitting across the table on the first date thinking, \"I can't wait to beat the shit out of this woman.\" He almost certainly doesn't plan to hit women at all.  How convenient. Women can read our minds and see what we think of them, but these guys who will beat their skull in with a pipe...those guys still totally respect them and everything, so they can't tell.  &gt;They're called \"women,\" and yeah, I've seen that. A dating website is a slightly different social context than a bar or a real-life gathering. I often assume that most people actually go out into the world and interact with other human beings to try and make friends and meet romantic partners, but that assumption is clearly wrong in this case.  Not when they're under the age of 18 they're not. Then they're, \"girls.\" Girls and women are both stupid, boring, and only care about looks (the latter fact is the same for men). Hence, I am talking about *females* here.  Your assumption is wrong in most cases. Most people are smart phone zombies. It's been that way for several years now. You want to talk to a female in person in The Current Year, you're going to have to get her to put her phone down first.  &gt;On a dating website, when she says she wants a well thought out message, she is STILL not asking you to send her a 65-page treatise on your personal hobbies and interests. She's saying, \"Tell me about yourself and what you're like and what you think we have in common and why you think I might like you.\" And if you think those are the same things, you've got a problem.  Hence, \"several sentences of substance.\" I didn't say this hypothetical incel wrote her a dissertation.   &gt;Only if every woman you know is an idiot and every man you know is an ass. Which I'm starting to sense is probably true, but, as I said before, that's your fault.  No. I've met my share of assholes and I've met my share of non-assholes. Coincidentally, many of the non-assholes are also incels, like me, while NONE of the assholes are.   &gt;In online dating? Yes, it absolutely is the same as telling someone to get lost. She's not coming out and saying it because she knows that what will probably come next is a barrage of abuse from you, so she's hoping if she just ignores you, you'll go away.  There's always an excuse for women's despicable claims and behavior.   \"A guy asked me out in a public place. #MeToo\" \"So what?\" \"It's inappropriate. I didn't want to make a scene and reject him in front of everyone.\"  \"A guy asked me out in a private place. #MeToo\" \"So what?\" \"It's inappropriate. It made me feel uncomfortable because he could have raped me and there would be no one around to stop him.\"  And now it's, \"she was afraid of a barrage of abuse!\" No, it's that she has no guts and expects the world to bend to her every whim.  &gt;If you have reached the age of 25 and never gotten laid or had a romantic relationship, it is not because you are physically unattractive. Ironclad guarantee. That is not possible.  Yeah, Joseph Merrick (Google him) was not incel because he was physically unattractive.   You're not even delusional at this point, you're just outright lying.  &gt;Do I really think you have any interest in listening to anyone who doesn't agree with you?  That's exactly what you stated your purpose was: To convince someone to agree with you.  &gt;You heard of growing a beard? They're all the rage right now and they work wonders for a bad face. Also you could see a dermatologist.  You heard of not being ABLE to grow a beard? Because some of us fall under this category.   Also, what does a dermatologist have to do with bad bone structure? They are mostly useless even for treating acne, which is the only applicability they have in the case of \"face.\"  &gt;No you wouldn't, and yes it would.  You are actually suggesting that face doesn't matter. Insane.  &gt;It's based on having known and encountered a whole lot of people like you.  And now generalizations are perfectly acceptable. No hypocrisy here or anything.  &gt;How would you have known what she liked? You never asked her what her interests were.  Because maybe this hypothetical incel either actually read her dating profile or had another brief conversation with her before she decided to ghost him (since a more physically attractive offer became available).  &gt;Yeah, I saw how she behaved in the conversation you made up. I happen to know a few men you would refer to as \"Chad.\" I've also seen them interact with their girlfriends and wives. There's a whole lot of conversing. Because, again, there actually are quality human beings out there in the world. The fact that you haven't met any of them is your fault.  You are using the term \"conversing\" extremely loosely. If you mean that she bitches at him about what to buy at the supermarket, then sure. If you mean that they have intelligent conversations, uh, no.  You can't fool me. I have actually lived in the real world.   &gt;Yep, again, attractive people have better luck getting no-strings hookups and casual dating. Those are the breaks.  And unattractive people won't get those things without being used for their resources. That's not what we want. We can't get what we want, and that's fine with some of us in and of itself. It's the fact that we are being lied to and insulted based on these lies as the paradigm that is pissing us off.   &gt;No, I'm just telling you what women have told me about how they respond to people like you. Because--I want to emphasize this--I have actual friends who are women, and they have actual conversations with me.  You're paraphrasing what they told you and putting it into more intelligent English, which is the first thing you're doing wrong. The second mistake you are making is believing a word that comes out of a woman's mouth. Lying is like breathing to women.  \n",

And yet--take a seat if you need to--I get laid. I have romantic relationships. They're not always great. They end, eventually. I haven't figured everything out about myself, let alone other people. But you've got a couple of misconceptions that make me want to take a crack at unpacking this here short screenplay.  &gt;these highly intelligent and sophisticated creatures.  Coming as it does right on the heels of phrases like \"fourteen-dimensional human beans,\" I've gotta say this sure seems like you don't really consider women to be intelligent or sophisticated. It seems like sarcasm. Here's the thing. You know how you can usually tell what someone really thinks of you, even if they try to hide it? Well, so can women.  &gt;You: Hey, substance, substance, substance substance, substance. Several sentences of substance.  See, that's actually not a very good way to start a conversation with *anyone*, whether you're trying to get laid or not. Usually, what we do is we say, \"Hello,\" or some other salutation like that. If we don't know the person--and let's just assume that you don't know this woman--we would say something to the effect of \"What is your name?\" It doesn't have to be those exact words, I'm just giving you guidelines here. Feel free to make it your own.  Now what might happen here, early in this conversation, is that she'll communicate to you that she's not interested in having a conversation. What you want to do if that happens is fuck off. She's not playing mind games, she's actually literally telling you the truth. And she has the right to do that! Sure, you could refuse to leave her alone, but that's what assholes do, and I know you're not an asshole. Right?  But a lot of times, she won't tell you to get lost. Great! Let's keep going. What we do now is we continue the process of getting to know someone. This isn't necessary in EVERY conversation with a random stranger, but if you have the inkling that you might want to be friends or more than friends with someone, you REALLY have to do it. And it's actually fun, if you care about other human beings and have any sense of empathy, which of course, you do, right? Of course you do. I don't even know why I asked.  Getting to know someone takes time. It might even take more than one conversation! And yes, it is absolutely harder if you're not Sexy Chad with the rock-hard abs, but dude, it is literally your fault that you're not as hot as Sexy Chad. It's my fault that I'm not as hot as Sexy Chad. I'd like to be, but I don't want to put in the work. It sounds like a drag. Every time I've tried it, it was a drag. Not worth it. But I don't get to complain when I have to put in more effort to get laid, and neither do you.  &gt;Her: lol. idk?  OK, I'm gonna guess that what you did here was you just launched into a dissertation about something you like, or are knowledgeable about, or are interested in. Physics, politics, Yu-Gi-Oh cards, baseball, who knows. It's great to have interests and hobbies and passions. But nobody likes being talked at. And that's what you did here. You talked at her. People--including women--generally prefer to have conversations, not exchanges of extemporaneous filibusters.  So \"lol. idk?\" doesn't at all mean what you think it means. It means \"I don't know who you are, guy. What was all that about?\" It means \"I don't actually share your interest in that subject.\" It means \"I am nervous about where this interaction is going, because I'm pretty sure it ends with you screaming at me and calling me a whore.\"  &gt;You: More sentences of substance. Would you like to get together some time?  Why? What basis do the two of you have for hanging out? All you've done is talk at her and she has expressed ZERO interest in you. You can't just manufacture desire when it isn't there. You gotta put in some effort, man, and in this scenario, you haven't done that.  &gt;Her: Maybe. idk  NO. SHE IS SAYING NO. TAKE THE HINT. You blew it this time, buddy. Take the L and work on your game like the rest of us.  &gt;Yummy Chad: hey Her: hey! :D  Hold on. You're telling me that this woman was attracted to an attractive man? Blow me tight, that's a mystery.  &gt;Yummy Chad: Netflix and chill at 8? Her: Sure! :d :p  Nope. Didn't happen.  &gt;If it's not pretty pictures, exclamation points, emoticons, inspirational quotes, shoes, dresses, skirts, fakeup, coffee, cooking recipes and pretty pixx of food, or her pet dog (and/or pet child who is HER WORLD), she's not going to care about that.  Guy, I'm not going to say there are no women out there who only care about bullshit. There are. Just like there are guys who only care about bullshit. But if those are the only women you encounter, the problem is YOU. I almost NEVER encounter those women. The wonderful women in my life--friends of mine--are people I went to college with, talked about life and the nature of reality and the universe with, argued politics with, worked with, laughed with, cried with, struggled with. Because the first principle of my interactions with any human being is, I want to find out if this person is cool and interesting, and if this person is cool and interesting, I want this person to be part of my life if it's at all possible. It's not \"I want to fuck.\" And sometimes, it works out that you get to fuck! Sometimes it works out that you get to be in a loving romance. Most of the time it doesn't, and that's fine.  If the only women you encounter are shallow idiots, then you need to elevate your life.\n",

Quality means censoring the stupidity of the moronic masses which results in unpopularity.  One may say \"Just pick quality.  Forget about the moronic masses.\"  But anything of pure quality will be so obscure due to unpopularity that the few intelligent people left in our godforsaken moronic world would not be able to find it.  Quite a dilemma.  I will propose a solution.  Make a second sub named something like BestOfBraincels.  The sub should only contain links to high quality posts on Braincels.  This sub should be ruthlessly censored to remove all low quality content.  There should be an announcement on Braincels linking directly to this new sub.  The morons can't complain since they can still post in Braincels.  So Braincels would have the popularity and the new sub would have the quality.  The quality sub would get exposure from the announcement link on the popular Braincels sub.  So this combines quality and popularity by linking them but keeping them separate to avoid the intrinsic conflict. \n",

You are right that not thinking you are owed sex by any woman you desire is more socially acceptable.  &gt;and by proactive, i mean acknowledging the unfairness of it and being upset.  That is very much not what \"proactive\" means. That is not proactive, reactive, or active in any sense. That is inactive. That is passive.  &gt;Regardless, their advice to incels is that we don't need sex and relationships - in other words, we can (and should) accept and adjust to a life without it.

I visited him at least twice a week to just talk to him and let him talk through his problems. He never once complained about himself being an incel, it never bothered him because I was voluntarily celibate. Sex was never a dominant thought for either of us because we valued trying to be good to other people, doing things for our other mutual friends and such. It was because of his fun-loving personality and his enjoyment of helping out friends that he was able to meet and date 2 average looking women during time in community college. He started going to a professional councillor who also helped him stop hating himself in private to a degree. He'd still have down days where it bordered on suicidal, but he would reach out to his friends those days and we'd hang out and talk.   Also it helps if you reach out to your friends and have them take you to places where you can meet women. My Friend and I (both male) both were casual friends with a few women for a year or two before we got into relationships with different unrelated women.   Even if some woman has no interest in you, it can still be beneficial to you if you try to be a genuine friend to her, as most women know other women who are single. only 25% of women are even ever married anyway by the [age of 25](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-will-everyone-i-know-be-married/). Women who you are good friends with tend to love to try to play matchmaker if they know someone who could potentially be interested in you.\n",

The caveat here is that they can only do this when **using another man's face, one that is good looking**.

Most incels hated women, which was never the point. The point was to hate society as we know it and to yearn for its fall and replacement with a better, more civilized society. Most incels never had such a revelation, so I do not think they were properly blackpilled.\n",
