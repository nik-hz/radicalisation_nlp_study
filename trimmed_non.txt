I got banned by b34nz for creating /r/trees and posting a link several times as a comment in /r/marijuana. It doesn't matter much to me.  Edit: He's also censored all of /r/marijuana by banning any submissions that disagree with him. Too bad that many of the other /r/marijuana subscribers won't be aware of this problem since we're being censored.
P.S: I fixed the CSS for "Submit a Link" that had been left broken for months in /r/marijuana
woot :D
I got banned as well. I'm tryin to think of it in positives though. I'll miss the vibe of /r/marijuana, but we'll get a better sense of comraderie in these smaller subreddits. 
The more I think about getting banned from /r/marijuana, the more I think it's a good thing. I can still read all of the threads and comments there. I can't comment, but that's fine because a larger sub-reddit will attract more attention. I'm not sure if I want that much attention to my marijuana related comments on Reddit.  It's also sad because that was my home on Reddit. But you can't let a moderator's ego get in the way of free flow of conversation.  You're right about getting a better sense of camaraderie.
my only complaint is the number of subreddits that were created. This is no offense to you, cinsere, but I wish we could all have consolidated our numbers, because I know there were more than just 14 people that unsubscribed from r/marijuana. for the meantime, I'll subscribe to all of them until further developments
I was banned as well. Already I have a multi with weed+trees+cannabis+trippy+woahdude in it. I think it would be cool if we could get all these subreddits talking and maybe all consolidate together?  Not likely at all, so any other subreddits I should add?
uhh, thenewweedit+stoners. What were you banned for, just wondering?
I was making posts calling him out on his bullshit and his hatred.
This is a fine poster who had better not be banned!
I hate people who limit the flow of information and ideas.  WHy the fuck would I want a racist running "the most relaxed" sub-reddit?
haha I can't tell whether or not this comment is tinged with sarcasm or not.
It's another link from /r/marijuana, but I feel like this topic is important. I felt like I was being snubbed back in March when Obama was asked this question.
It's legit.  You shouldn't be banned for having an opinion or posting links.  That's BS.
An oldie but a goodie.
Honestly, the racism isn't as bothersome as the censorship. 
will do cinsere, keep up the good work!
Cool. Thanks for the note of support!
I'm with you.  I don't know why I said that.  I've learned to filter racism....It doesn't bother me all that much, it's part of being on the internet.  You know what another part of being on the internet is?   NOT CENSORING THINGS
Recently in the City of Garden Grove, California - police confiscated an 8 gram bag - then spent $139,000 in court defending itself - and lost - meaning they were ordered to pay the patient's $100,000 in legal fees as well.  So the city lost $239,000 - over an 8 gram bag of pot - that they had to RETURN, by order of the court!  This is NOT related to the Original Post.  How many times does this situation have to play out until we stop wasting money, and law enforcement begins to follow the law?
is this the truth? I saw your comment here which lead me to here. if there really is something fishy going on, I can intercede on your behalf with the reddit gods. it would be a shame to see strife in what was a very prim and tidy reddit.
Who be dat!!! I smell NARCOTICS.    please sir can i have some more.
and cookies?
That is something that good ol' Abe and I have in common
Why are you posting about trees in /trees??
....I don't see why not?
i'm not banned, but i started [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/9u7r2/dear_b34nz_youre_doing_a_great_job_but_the_new/) and its gone.  of course.
I prefer the Larch. I can recognize them from quite a long way away.
She's wasting all that smoke...
He wasn't "Honest Abe" for nothing. :)
I got banned!  But it happened *after* I unsubscribed.  I also got him back by posting [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/cannabis/comments/9ug83/wtf_the_mod_of_rmarijuana_is_a_racist_xenophobe/).
Me too. I had already unsubscribed when I first heard the calls of revolution.
I'm here, I love trees!
if you can do something, do it
That shit gets you so high
That was a sad day for sure :( 
Reminds me of [Jason Lauve](http://www.colorado420.com/news/lauve/), who got his 34 oz. back directly after the trial. I hope it wasn't stored improperly like that guy's. :(
I'm a [Jeffrey Pine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Pine) person myself. They smell like vanilla.
I told them to make it a moddless reddit or just set the mod to invis. what I asked was whether user/cinsere was indeed banned from the /mj reddit, or if any others were.
There is a duck head and another thing sort of duck like hidden in the branches. 
i feel like this is a protest subreddit almost  hopefully we can move back though, id hate to loose the 20,000 redditors who made that place great
Done. Credit goes to [hentai](http://reddit.com/user/hentai) for processing the new logo for trees.
And credit (creddit?) goes to [lovesthetrees](http://www.reddit.com/user/lovesthetrees), the great Canadian artist, for the image itself.
I'd like to hang this picture on the wall of our new living room. :)
I added your drawing to the footer of this sub-reddit. Hope you like it.
Whoa, that's so cool! Thanks, man. I'm glad you like my tree. :D
I find trees really hard to draw, yet done right they are mind blushingly cool. Like [van Gogh's Mulberry Tree](http://www.digital-images.net/Images/NS_Paint/vGogh_MulberryTree_3385.jpg). 
That looks like a good tree, what's it like for climbing?
yes i stole the pineapple from mischief (thanks)  too lazy to edit out blue lines  
"bbeen blown"
That looks like a christmas tree!
mmy bbad
My mom adheres to that belief :)
i heard he tested positive for not writing all those plays... or somthin like that
because his name looks to be spelled in elvish thats why
Your tree has no leaves. It makes me sad. Its like the fate of r/mj. Just makes me sad.
Its ok. Looks like someone who was either high or angry made it. I feel as though both of those are appropriate in this case. 
PINEAPPLES ARE DELICIOUS BUT I'M MOTHERFUCKING AWARE OF THE DAMN PINEAPPLE UPVOTES SO QUIT RUBBING IT IN THAT I'M NOT EATING A PINEAPPLE RIGHT NOW
I did!
I remember getting really high with one once, but then I fell out.  
For you, [the first green leaves of hope](http://imgur.com/SHXMm).
you are a girl.  and you make funny.  amazed.
"allthough"
of fuck, the commas are killing me, stapling my feet to this cause
Doing the rounds as we speak.
ps.  ballin! muchas gracias 
I am vindicated.
No hay problemas. Es por eso que estoy aqu√≠. :)
Just subscribed to this subreddit, one of the first things i said to myself was "wow that logo is very warm and friendly feeling." noticed this thread about 5 reddits down and became very alarmed only to find the masterminds who made it all happen. haha
I like juicy jays mango papers but its usually Zig Zag blue.
I wasn't banned, but I support my fellow Weedit community of all race and class. So here we are, new home :)
I'll support anything 420. :)  Although the purpose of /r/trees now is to replace /r/marijuana (if possible). That's why we have the default style and feel of the old place.
Whoever took that picture was having a great day!
Definitely a fan of the new logo
Ah.... true. lol :)  But check me out. I'm practically the sole mod of [/r/gonewild](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild) which is one of the best managed subreddits out there. I'm also the mod for [/r/portland](http://www.reddit.com/r/portland) and a few others. I'm always high. Whether I'm high or sober I'm still relaxed. I've always respected benevolent leaders.  I hate the drama we see with people fighting over power. This is supposed to be a peaceful place. Until this place warrants help moderating with more traffic then I plan to keep things flowing the way it is now. Although if people disagreed then I *would* relinquish control. No probs.
zigzag orange is my all time goto papers.  recently tho, i've been enjoying [Klear](http://klearpapers.com/) papers.
We're here for you. :)
If you like ZigZag blues then you should consider trying the Export Aquafuge (green) papers. They're nice and thick, like the blues, for when you have clumsy fingers.
Hello. :)
Cinsere passes the sniff test with me.  We disagreed politically, discussed about it over a J, and guess what?  He's awesome.  
I'm subscribed both here and there. I have enough weed love for many reddits. 
Mind = Blown
I'd like to try while tripping balls. Although even just stoned it's like danceable Fantasia spliced with Alice in Wonderland.
works best when trying to drink and roll
1. errors 2. that someone that questioned him and uncovered how messed up he is was me, hi! 3. he makes us accomplices to his racist crap. enough is enough.  4. from b34nz sent 2 minutes ago  you've been banned  you have been banned from posting to Marijuana: smoking, growing, news, and laws..  to b34nz sent 193 milliseconds ago  re: you've been banned  I hope your daughter is impregnated outside marriage by a Muslim from Africa... and I hope she turned him  straight...ish from gay.  You can't stop me from posting here, you stupid little twit.

I got banned for this:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/9uktc/proof_b34nz_isnt_such_a_bad_guy_afterall_pic/c0eiekw  To be fair, though, it is quite critical of b34nz himself.
This video is one of the most captivating things i have seen in a long time  the youuutuuube version makes it even crazier
I like hemp papers the best. Hempire or the Joker hemp papers are probably my favorites. 
zig zag white, all the way
I've never been a fan of rice papers to be honest...too slick for me. 
Eh, I could never really get into the klears. I know it's not actually plastic but it weirds me out to smoke it anyways.
you cant go wrong with the dutchmasters.   i know it is more work than the wraps as you have to unwrap, split, roll, and then wrap it back up...but the extra work is worth it :P
Good enough for me. I'll presume anyone a good person till they show me otherwise.
this sounds pretty reasonable to me
raw. they roll well, have a good consistancy and smoke clean
can't we have, like, a dormant mod? Like godzilla, someone who would just sleep for eons until (if ever) the time came to rise up and fight off the giant moth that kept those asian twins from getting naked?

I heard if the thread author puts something funny here, it gets upvoted a lot.  The thing is, formulaic humor stinks when I do it, and I usually have to improvise.  Therefore I had better contribute something.  [I am smoking an atom smasher](http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s42/XIxZer0xIX/smasherbowlgreen.jpg?t=1255680444);  I heat up the tip with a torch and smash it down onto some concentrates.
The new logo is seriously sweet.  It's still not work-safe, but neither am I!  It's less obnoxious than the other logo was...  Classy is the word I am looking for.
I'm good here.  I didn't even get banned. I just dislike authoritarians sans brains
Personally, I tend to have very englightening ideas when I am medicating.  I feel like I work a lot of things out on a physical and metal health level, especially in the treatment of internal scar tissue in my diaphram.  However, it is difficult for me to type something out in detail, as one fraction of a thought usually ends up taking hours to type, by which time I have had several million more thoughts.  This is my quandry, and your bane, as I love to post while I am medicating.    I generally get good results at my favorite bbs, And in real life I feel as though I am feeling  really great. Yet on reddit, people usually tear me apart.  I give myself a 17 for reddit success. I've always been unique, but it has never been a problem in real life.  I generally get abused, red envelope wise, by a few of the reddits, especially anything related to current events.  My opinion on current events is VERY unnerving to many people for some reason, and I get downvoted a lot.  In neutral forums, my random comments are generally not upvoted or downvoted in many others.   Sometimes I get some a really good comment that becomes popular, but not frequently.    
Operation: BlowTrees, a success!
swisher grape
hell yeah
Agreed, the ones you rip to the desired length are particularly awesome 
Love it! Much more iconic, much less tacky.
Rice papers IMO are the best. "Smoking Blue King Size" only for me.   Tip: You can tell the quality of the rolling paper by taking one and lighting it on fire. The less ash left over the better the paper.
Rizla Blue. Not too thick, not too thin...juuuuuust right.
Zig Zag Black Rips.
Post this in r/reddit.com, so others can see it?
to me the best papers are the ones that add the smallest amount of foreign smoke to the weed.  so my favourite 'paper' is my bong :)  but rizlas are good too...
ZigZag used to make one with a pocket at the bottom. They made it really easy to roll fast and sloppy, but I think they've been gone a long time. I switched to EZ Wider Wheatstraw because they have a better grip, but I just use Rizla Blue now.
yeah yeah! And if you'd like it in any other format, I can supply it.   Maybe I should make the leaf smaller and text bigger. I'll do it tonight.   Who should I send it to? 
cinsere would be the fellow to speak to, just above me.
THanks! and on the same note, I'd like to know WHY you don't believe it should be legalized. Not an argument, but a discussion.
Rizzla licorice FTW!  By far my favorite papers out there :)
Oh dammit! Now I can't post my enormous cock in /gonewild without it following me to my homely /trees. OH THE SHAME!
Amazing fucking album. Neal Peart's lyrics are soooo right wing XD
This is not [trees](http://www.treesdallas.com). This is not trees at all. This is likened to the Conch Republic. You counter-cultureites sure have a way of naming a thread. Easily misconstrued by arborists.
You can play the harmonica? Cool!
[insensitive case-sensitive url fail](http://www.reddit.com/R/TREES/) :(  
Don't kid yourself man, most of the subscribers don't post anything, or vote, or comment. There's another ten (at least) people for every subscriber who haven't even registered yet still read every day. That subscriber number doesn't mean much.  If the majority of the *active* posters move here (I'd guess around 100-500 people), so will the culture, and then /r/mj will die. This is not unlikely, since the people who care enough to post actively almost certainly care enough to participate in this vote of no confidence and move elsewhere if necessary.  I just feel bad for crashing the party in /r/cannabis. I worry more that their subreddit culture will get fucked over during this mess than I do about r/mj.  If you want to speed the transition, then start posting content. Lots and lots of cool content.
no, ohio..... lol
You guys should check out  REDDIT.COM/R/STONERS  The tree elected mods started their own subreddit. It's the relaxed marijuana subreddit!
[link for the stoned](http://www.reddit.com/r/stoners)
My concerns exactly. I hope the admins can do something to help us.   *Wink*
The last one would make a good Christmas gift. 
I am a big fan of Hempires.
Thanks! And on the same note, I'd like to SHAMELESSLY plug reddit.com/r/stoners. Not that shameless, but borderline spamming. 
Randy's, because of the built in roach clip, are great to use when you're passing the J in the dark, but my favorite is RAW.
Viva la resistance!!!  The melting point of THC is 200 ¬∞C (392 ¬∞F) so I would imagine that temp or a little warmer would be a good temp.  However, I am not a vape expert.
you're fine. If you would have [made a link right to it](http://www.reddit.com/r/stoners) then it would have been spamming
Oh shit, i built a vaporizer using this [heat gun](http://www.amazon.com/Grizzly-H0800-Heat-Gun-1200/dp/B0000DD1KP/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hi&amp;qid=1255711137&amp;sr=8-1) because of the adjustability of the range then find a metal screen, some copper pipe fittings that can attach to one another, a turkey oven bag (must be oven bag because it eliminates resin/stickage to the inside of the plastic from the vape, and some imagination.   Mine gets me ripped but it looks like im some type of backwoods weed until i get super blazed!!! And please someone let me know if im using something toxic... lol  EDIT: sorry was high and forgot to tell you vape temp should be 190C or 370F
naked asian twins goood.
sounds good to me too.
dude, this thing was crazy sober
I think it's a canadian thing. When i was in the US they didn't even have them at the stores... but that was Ocean City MD
how the fuck is he still the moderator?? This is obviously a problem, why haven't the admins booted him yet?
sawweeeet.  but what's wrong with the fan leaves..too hot?  they are canoeing pretty bad there.
With my addiction? Nonsense! I can stop any time I want!
I'm pretty sure they take the stance that if you don't agree with the way he runs *his* subreddit, then start a competitor. The issue is whether or not he should have total control over a very generic subreddit. I think the community is becoming irritated that it is being displaced so he can maintain a monopoly over the traffic drawn in by the use of the generic term as the name of his subreddit.  I think the way to get the admins to ban him would be to follow him around in mass pointing out that he has turned our /marijuana subreddit into a tool for essentially trolling reddit, and we don't agree with it.
That's a nice big joint man. Good one. 
Done. http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9ur7s/the_weedit_revolt_pic/
Thanks!
i definitely messaged them, in a crying attempt, but i havent heard back yet, ill post whatever they say but... im still waiting
shit, i need to put a tree in there dont i...
im glad i can upvote every single comment of every post here without much difficulty... its cozy here
I always heard that to just get the THC (stuff that makes you high) it need to be between 310 and 330 degrees F. To vaporize the other cannabinoids (some have the pharmaceutical benefits that make medicinal marijuana possible) the temperature needs to be higher, maybe around 370 degrees F.
Thanks (:
see, ive been vaping for a while, and ive found, while not all vapes are at the same temp? the halfway mark on any dial is gonna be the way to go unless you already have learned the peice.  youre gonna save weed by vaping lower and youlll still get some nice light milky godlyness.    stay high
faggotron FTW!
dude... youre really fuckin cool you know that?
dude right now, we kinda need to piggy back for the good of our countrymen... nobody will call you a troll... maybe a little kidd troll with blue hair, but a big douchey troll like the ones in the hobbit? nahh you're chill dude
great trees thanks
actually yeah i kinda wanna hear why too, just for the sake of discussion 
honestly? no, i think the reason the whole thing got fucked up was lame... but the level it got taken to? im not gonna be a part of that immature fucks world... until i see him on the street... then i might get pissed, but ill probly just see if hes down to shmeezle shmaima
you can do whatever you want... just know that were here to judge you  but were all high, so who gives a fuck
you're like Gandhi

Only the best use raw. It's great for my cigarettes.
I spy with my little eye... RAW brand rolling paper.
Swishers Grape, Swishers Menthol 
I would strongly recommend **not** using a heat gun in a vaporizer, or any kind of vaporizer that heats air directly that is being inhaled.  This is because heated metal reacts with air and produces a huge amount of free radicals and ozone (both forms of highly reactive oxygen), which then get carried off in the stream of hot air, and then inhaled.  Free radicals cause oxidative damage to DNA and body tissues, and are a leading suspected cause of cancer and aging.  It is for this reason that most high-end vaporizers heat a glass tube which separates the air stream inhaled from the air directly on the heating element.  If personal health is a concern, I would strongly advise a system that does not pump air directly from the heating element into your lungs.
yeah sorry about all the errors, i was really mad, and it was inbewteen classes n shit, totally had an exam i was going to when i wanted to do it so... yeah kinda rushed through it but i thought it still got the message across apart from the grammatical mess i am   thank you by the way for pointing out what a douche that guy is
Yup, I want the weed and the weed only inhaled.
I just made an observation and the douche came stream out.   Nice graphic for being rushed! There's some serious skill in those hands, my friend.
I posted it in /r/marijuana, sure it'll get deleted though.
the ideal temperature is 420 degrees
I'm not stoned, but I AM lazy. Upvote.
ooooh, Randy's. i havn't used those in forever. god, those things are great. the paper may not be the best, but that built in wire kicks ass :)
i hope i get banned for [this](http://imgur.com/UFnpV.jpg) NSFW
PINEAPPLES!!!
Ha ha, no need to apologize for being high. Can be hard to remember everything you set out to say when you start writing :)  Thanks, sounds good. I was planning on making a similar rig to what you described. 
just wanted to let yalls know i just got banned from r/marijuana for [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/stoners/comments/9utdv/nsfwthis_is_b34nz_teh_evil_dictat0r_in_real_life/) NSFW  feels kinda good now actually 
It's more of a club for people who blow trees.  Trying to think of a "roots run deep" joke.
It's darn big of you to come out and say so.  As you can tell from my username, there's little I value more above the principles of true freedom.  I study constitutional law as a hobby.  That being said, it is fair if you do not wish to associate with the *culture* of marijuana - I agree that it isn't for everyone, nor is it very "accessible".  However, I think you may be surprised at the number of individuals you could get along with and potentially respect, without ever knowing that they medicate.  As far as legalization goes:  Remember, freedom of speech is predicated upon the concept of Liberty.  True liberty.  
My friend has parkinsons real bad, he accidently ate a gram of hash oil and discovered that it stopped his parkinsons tremors for 5 days. Now he takes a quarter gram a day and none of his prescription. This is my good friend and we accidently discovered that large doses of hash oil (Rick Simpson oil) releives the tremors of his parkinsons disease, now we have found others who are experiencing the same thing, So here ya go Michael J. Fox, we got further than your scientists and got high doing it.
Multiple studies are coming out, despite the fact that studying cannabis as a medicine is ILLEGAL at the federal level, that suggest that cannabis attacks mutated cells, while rejuvinating healthy cells.  This makes it a very effective treatment for a vast array of degenerative diseases.
It depends on what kind of effect you are after.  Lower temps(between 320 and 340F) are going to be more heady, while 360 and up will be more narcotic.
wait it creates ozone? don't we have a problem with huge holes in the ozone? so you're telling me that all we have to do is heat some fucking metal and bam - no more gigantic holes in the ozone? i find that hard to believe.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I always keep this in my wallet.
If you haven't watched the whole movie then you should check it out. It was pretty useful for picking up a few tips although most of it seems like common sense.
When you're in a panic or never been in a tough situation like this before, I think it's good to rehearse in your mind what to do ahead of time so you act correctly almost automatically. Just sharing it because this video has been useful to help keep my mind at ease.

Any sufficiently heated metal produces ozone - this is the characteristic smell of arc welders, lightning, electric motors, blenders and the like.  The problem with the approach you describe is that ozone is so violently reactive that any of it produced at sea level is going to be long gone by the time it could get into the atmosphere at the level of the ozone layer (typically it degrades on its own into O2 within half an hour).  If we could run a million blenders at 90,000 feet for a while, it might work.  But it probably wouldn't be worth it.
I see this and can only think about how awesome it would be to be the brown haired toy man.  BTW: Totally had me thinking something else with that tittle.

I know this is not the place to ask, but I can figure it out how to remove my self from a group (I used to add or drop groups with a simple Add/remove botton now I cant find that)  On a second note, I also hope you are not a racist and ignorant like the other moderator... sorry if I come on strong but you should know why
Maybe they could create r/deciduous.
50 bucks for a good 1/8th is common here in the western ny, and yes that is too bloody much.
no, but you should look at [this](http://imgur.com/UFnpV.jpg)

b34nz it is obvious you have had a brain snap and have now decided to cause maximum negative impact with your actions.  This post in particular is one of the most immature acts I have seen on this site.    What possible outcome are you trying for here?    * Get more attention.  If that is the case what part of your psyche is getting buzzed by wanting this sort of attention * Have you lost the ability to discern the results of your behavior. * Are you throwing the baby out with the bathwater, ie you have completely fucked your reddit cred and now want to go down punching  For someone who mods a weed based subreddit you are painting it into the worst light possible.  You come across as a deeply paranoid and troubled soul.  Perhaps you need to get off the weed for a little while and get some perspective back, because dude you have seriously lost touch.

&gt;I know this is not the place to ask, but I can figure it out how to remove my self from a group (I used to add or drop groups with a simple Add/remove botton now I cant find that)  No problems. About a month ago the layout of Reddit got changed. It's no longer "Add / Remove". Now it's "+Frontpage / -Frontpage".  &gt;On a second note, I also hope you are not a racist and ignorant like the other moderator... sorry if I come on strong but you should know why  Nawww, I'm chill. I live in diverse house within a very diverse city that has very progressive politics. I'm even in an interracial relationship if that counts for anything, lol. No other known issues. I just like getting high.
That's awesome! Link?

That's the price of legal weed. I know it's pretty damn outrageous but proponents (like myself) say that it's a stepping stone toward legalization.
It reminded me of [/r/gonewild](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild) when I read the title.
Oh wow!!! I loved Legos as a kid.
My thinking exactly.
Thanks
Hm. I pay $25 for an eight in B.C., your situation sounds terrible =(
That's cheap for fire like that... consider yourself some of the lucky few
Thank you, I guess. You have four downvotes against you, so I'm going to upvote you.
I'd rather not get into it. Thanks anyway.
That's adorable! What do you want to be when you grow up?
Have you ever really looked at an oak tree... naw man, I mean *really looked* at an oak tree?  win win as far as I'm concerned...
I just think it's more important to live by principles, rather than my own prejudices. That, I think, ties into what Voltaire said about speech: "I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it. "  It's less important to me that my opinion differs from yours, than it is to preserve the inalienable right for both of us to speak it.
Just like you, a self righteous prick.

Oh, you're serious about this, aren't you? Okay, well, good luck.

How do they compete with illegal weed for more than $10/gram?
i respect your decision but I do feel if your going to quote Voltaire you should be willing to debate about laws that send your neighbors to jail when consumption does not harm you
Welcome to the [Coalition of the Weedits!](http://imgur.com/vQB7Q.png)
So you're saying it should all be discussed in /r/botanty?  I agree.
I already pay $50/eighth and would willingly pay more to get it in a legal fashion.
Same thing, posting somewhere is different from being somewhere... still can't call you a hypocrite. ;) 
I always see people refer to /r/marijuana as /r/mj, then people get in a fuss over beanz, and create a new subreddit called /r/trees among all things, when /r/mj is available as a subreddit.
I'm surprised no one created /r/mj because it doesn't exist yet.
thanks
what about the 420+ various components of weed? are you trying to say they all have the same vapor point?
Oh yeah!   I have 2 volcano's and would not give them up for the world.   The various active components volatilize at different temperatures, so a lower temperature will yield more of the ingredient THC, while higher volatilize more CBD.   
"Stay out of the trees, they'll trip you up"
it says it wont work. :( i've tried
"Medical card" is a bit of a misnomer. In California, a patient whose doctor has "recommended" the use of medical cannabis as treatment is protected by law. This recommendation typically comes in the form of a letter written and signed by the attending physician, with an expiration date no more than a year following the initial recommendation. While a recommendation from your General Care Doctor will be sufficient in a court of law, for ease of verification both by law enforcement and by dispensaries/delivery services, it is recommended, though not required, that you apply for a state card. The state has set up a special process for this, which is handled by your County Department of Health. Aside from the (non-required) State Card, **MOST PATIENTS DO NOT HAVE AN ACTUAL MEDICAL CARD**. Some doctors provide a written recommendation in addition to a 'verification card,' but few if any dispensaries and/or law enforcement officials accept these; you're only really protected if you have your original recommendation handy. Employment background checks and others should not have trouble, as the information is between you and your doctor only, unless you choose to report it to the State Department Of Health (via the county). I do not know, but I have not heard of any issues this may have caused for any patients. FWIW, some legitimate doctors will require either regular visits to maintain a doctor-patient relationship so that they may follow and adjust your treatment, other legitimate doctors will at least require paperwork showing that you are currently under the care of another doctor. Less reputable doctors will write a recommendation with no proof; these recommendations may get you in the door at a dispensary, but will not go far in defending a 'patient' in a court of law.
The flavor can be a pleasing surprise that you find on your lips during your session. 
There's absolutely no way I can disagree with that concept.  I've run afoul of many users on Reddit, mainly because my political beliefs are considered "wacky".  Yet one thing I am very proud of, is that I have never abdicated a discussion and "declared victory", I have never attempted to censor anyone...It's a disturbing commentary on contemporary society when I am actually ready to *thank you* for being reasonable, supporting the concepts of true freedom, and attempting to foster an environment where information exchange can happen freely.  I see very little of that these days.   You may notice an overwhelming sense of desperation from the individuals here, as they try with all their might to pull you into this discussion regarding why you do not support legalization or associate with individuals who medicate.  I think it is sourced from the fact that there are so few rational people who don't partake in the plant itself, yet refuse to view us as useless human waste.  I believe that homogenizing any group is going to skew your perception of them, and generalizing us all as stoners (which outside sources have done - not you) is an inaccurate barometer for each of us as individuals.    The propoganda, and the hatred that we deal with is truly staggering, and it is not something I could have envisoned empathetically before "switching sides" and becoming friends with cannabis.    Before I started medicating, I had depression, asthma, and insomnia, and generally did well to okay in school.  After I started medicating, I was able to cure my depression, my asthma, and my insomnia, permanantly.  I also made it onto the dean's list before graduating college, receiving mostly 4.0's for my last two years there.    Fast forward a few years, and I have successfully removed myself from all synthetic medications, which I have had foisted upon me since childhood.    There's a lot to this plant, to be honest.  I believe it can save lives.  Preliminary research is showing that can reverse and cure both parkinson's disease, and cancer, as well as many other ailments.  Personally, I'd like research to be done, but there is currently a law stating that if you do any research (i.e. announce that you've cured cancer), men with guns will come to your house, abuse your family, steal your property, and violate your right to life, liberty and property.  We are desperately searching for an avenue through which we can move forward in a peaceful manner.  Most of us are labeled criminals, yet most of us have never run afoul of The Common Law once in our lives.  It truly is a crisis of liberty.  I think, for this reason, a lot of people are desperate to get individuals like you on our side.  The moral support, and support of our natural and inherant rights such as free speech, is truly refreshing, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  My contention is that it is also a natural right for me to ingest this plant, if I wish to do so peacefully, and use it as a medicine.  Please consider my position.  
Speaking your mind is the new crime.  Just remember, everything is illegal, except for the stuff that's mandatory.
I always say, "Good Luck." as they leave.

There is a fairly strong body of evidence, which is touted as non-conclusive by apologists, which suggests that the works of William Shakespeare were written by Sir Francis Bacon, who was generally one of the most respected statesmen of his day.  He had a lot to do with the philosophies behind the foundation of America, and he was the favorite student of the world's greatest living alchemist at that time, John Dee.  John Dee signed all his correspondance 007, and Ian Flemming has admitted that in the novels, James Bond is supposed to be partially a tribute to John Dee, the mentor of Francis Bacon.  Reportedly, nobody came to Shakespeare's funeral.  The man, Shakespeare, was not a celebrated playwrite during his life.  By some accounts, he was not even respected.  Yet his *plays* were very celebrated.  Why the diconnect?  Further,  21 plays were published after his death, through an attourney.    Many of Shakespeare's plays deal with the intricacies of the royal court, and makes several humerous commentaries about the state of royal life at that time period.  It is not likely that Shakespeare, who was an uneducated physical laborer, possessed the wherewithall or experience to make complex jokes about the intricacies of the royal court, a system to which he had no firsthand access whatsoever.  Francis Bacon, on the other hand, was the bastard son of the Queen of England.  You do the math.  It is a lot of fun reading!  William T. Still has several good books on the matter.
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,  So far from variation or quick change?  Why with the time do I not glance aside  To new-found methods, and **to compounds strange?**  Why write I still all one, ever the same,  And **keep invention in a noted weed,**  That every word doth almost tell my name,  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?  O! know sweet love I always write of you,  And you and love are still my argument;  So all my best is dressing old words new,  Spending again what is already spent:  For as the sun is daily new and old,  So is my love still telling what is told.  -Shakespeare

As Aristotle said, **"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain an idea, without accepting it."**    We should all be upvoting Nourn for that reason.
That [has already been on the front page of reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9rapl/a_personal_account_of_treating_a_9_year_olds/). 
The one line of this article that really irritates me is this:  &gt; I was intrigued when a homeopath suggested medical marijuana.  In my eyes, any association between homeopathy and medical cannabis (deliberate or otherwise) is very bad. Homeopathy cannot possibly* have any effects aside from placebos, and anyone advocating it as a form of treatment is giving horrible medical advice. Unfortunately, the author seems ignorant in this regard, and it hurts her credibility.  _* In case you aren't aware, this is the case because the amount of dilution required for a solution to be considered homeopathic is sufficient to reduce the average number of_ molecules _of the active ingredient per dose to close to essentially zero. That's the principle of it, and has no basis in anything remotely scientific._ 
Ah shit, I so didn't need to see that. lol. I guess I'm not that crafty with my titles. d:
Did someone say bacon?!
&gt;when /r/mj is available as a subreddit  actually, it's not. apparently you can't have a sub with only a 2 letter name :(
So, if you were stopped on the street, an office would require an original recommendation letter and not a state card?  Medical dispensaries usually only check for a state card, correct?
An officer would require the original recommendation letter OR the state card; either should be verifiable by the officer's dispatch  The state card *should* hold more weight with law enforcement officers. Medical dispensaries in So. Cal will only accept the ORIGINAL Doctor's recommendation. In Nor. Cal, from what I understand, the card is more frequently used.
Man I haven't done that in awhile. Maybe next Friday...  12 Coors Light Dub Sack Halo 3.   See you Saturday around 2pm. 
I LOVE THEM TOO! Total high five, bro!
Thanks for clearing that up. I'm in SoCal and have access to a state card, but I'm not sure about an original doctor's recommendation.
You can only get the state card with an original doctor's recommendation. How else would you have access to it?
I was the little brown haired toy man.. with out man part q:
I got banned too. *HIGH FIVE!*  EDIT: To get compensation, making [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9uhm0/the_lone_moderator_of_rmarijuana_has_been_posting/) made me feel better.
Agreed. I made my best buddy watch these, as well as the ALCU videos. We're the safest two guys in the world.
Dude... yes. On LSD the trees became SO significant one time... I swear they had souls. They were living entities.
Mr. Vagabond wants to get a counterfeit card. He says he has access to someone who makes the cards.  **This makes ALL legitimate patients look bad.**   Not to mention, *it makes me sick*
Are you sure without the man part? Because I mean maaaaaaaaaaaan that looks like some good stuff. And if your a woman, there is a man in woman.

Haha, yeah I'm a girl. d:
We're collaborating (wingman187, cinsere, and myself) on creating a weedit coalition of subreddits. Basically, we're looking to standardize mod set and policies across several weedits to serve the community better. So far we have /potheads, /stoners, /trees. We need to approach /cannabis.   Do you all like this idea?
By the way, are these Legos or another brand? Don't recognize them :/
Alice in Wonderland is way better sober than on Acid, when I tried to watch it on Acid I just lost interest in it really fast...But this video is fun to watch while tripping, your eyes feel overloaded. Plus this song is amazing, I heard all kinds of crazy things in the song while tripping.
Another brand, I never actually had like the real name brand toys as a kid. I think they were from Family Dollar I can't remember..
I paid $75 for a damn good 1/8th in northern ny.
Oh no, you couldn't have non articulating hands/arms! :P I had legos,if they had these at Family Dollar...man, I was jipped! 
Looks like she had a c-section.
haha q: You seem very knowledgeable of the Lego land, but yeah that or some other cheap store. Or else their old and left from one of my four older brothers. 
Nice.  I actually like this one.  ;)

I'm pretty sure entomology is the way to discuss it.  Then again, /economics is all about Ron Paul, so what shit should be isn't really what it ought be anyway...
there's also r/weedit, created by thumperings. I think this is where most of the community is migrating. 
HOLY SHIT THAT'S AN AWESOME LOGO!
Yea same happened to me...I've done nothing but try to be a friendly helpful person...and I dared to mention in a civil and mature manner in a certain thread in /cannabis that a certain person was perhaps being un-modlike and was banned for it.  
It's wildly inaccurate to state that THC is the stuff getting you high and other cannabinoids don't. THC all by itself will make you all kinds of fucked up, but not in a very nice way.  You'll be smashed, paranoid, but not very giggly or happy. I say this having been a guinea pig for a study at the university where I now work, and was injected with THC alone and a mixture of THC and other cannabinoids that mimicked the balance found in weed. THC alone was quite unpleasant, and not something I'd want to do again. Smoking weed is something I'm doing right now, however :D
In another thread he says he quit weed a while ago. Maybe that is part of the problem. He's so psycho he needs meds to calm him down. I wish he'd get back to smoking so he can chill the fuck out.
I have a joint and a hug for you.  Community is still here, we just have some Assholes to work around &lt;3
He looks a bit like Wil Farrell.  Good video. Anybody have any tips on how to transport larger quantities? Like an elbow or so?
No way! Trees... living entities? Whoa. I need to try some LSD.  JK!
I just subscribed to everything I could and figured I'd drop anything that wasn't interesting o.o;
dang.
Well that's dumb!
I have for some reason assumed that the "worse" the weed is, the higher temperature I need to set..as in the THC is extracted at a good rate at a lower temp (370F or so) with some dank, but a higher temp (~430F) is necessary for vaping not so kine bud.  hypothesis: The longer you can burn at a lower temp the more THC you get. i.e. Making oil for brownies is best done in a crock pot on low heat for 24hours.
|Yes! I think that guy sounds like an upstanding American that I would like to be associated with.   i don't object him for insulting muslims. that's his right protected by first amendment. but i do object banning people for no good reason. insulting someone is never good reason for harsh actions (eg. ban), because insult is also protected by the first amendment.  but i do object him being utter moron and stripped down shadow of a soulless human being. according to him, anyone with similar characteristics is 'upstanding american'. and because reddit in general is overloaded by morons i would expect him to have support here on reddit.    
[/r/stoners](http://www.reddit.com/r/stoners) agrees.  We're already linking to [/r/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees), and [/r/potheads/](http://www.reddit.com/r/potheads) has been established to provide nothing but links to all the weedits.
weeeediters unite!   You're doing a great job cuntsmeller! 
oh cuntsmeller, I have to say. It is quite fun typing your name. Do you realize how thankful I am to have a reason to type cunt, and then to make it better. I can say cuntsmeller. Lovely!
i just did. and might again (as long as it's before 12:00!)
is this a joke?
Love the art sir.
Thanks :)
    *stretches yawns sips puffs grins*  Mighty fine work. My favorite so far! Keep goin'! 
well done! this embodies my life at the moment
and it will only get better!
It needs more mods to prevent a dictatorship. Who knows if cinsere is like b34nz or not?
210 actually
I agree! Also, the more mods the merrier, but let's give cinsere credit for imparting /r/trees with at least some of its positive ambiance (not to mention the motivation and effort to get it started and filled with furniture)!
Thanks :D
It could use a few more people. The fact that I can't post to marijuana (I was banned, of course) is starting to annoy the fuck out of me.
/r/cannabis helps. I subscribe to both.
I do as well. I'm just annoyed that a stupid racist douchebag can essentially ruin a huge community. The complete lack of any respond from the admins has actually ruined reddit for me a bit.
/r/weed has more subscribers.  Next we'll have /r/pot, /r/schwag, /r/smoke, /r/grass, /r/chronic, /r/bud and 10 other differentiations of the same thing.  Too many subreddits on the exact same subject, IMO.
Coffee and weed.  Nothing quite like it.  Coffee and weed.  Edit:  And a beer.
It has more subscribers but nobody is uploading content there. Out of the last 10 submissions there, 6 of them are from me.
I can't comment on the thread because I was banned (for a comment I made here in Trees, not for anything I did over there). I do agree we need to organize or do something. The reddit admins don't seem to give a shit, so we need to take the next step somehow.
haven't seen any hateful posts by cinsere so thats a good start but agree more mods
A classic essay for both stoners and Carl Sagan fans (and the large overlap of those two groups). A+++ WOULD UPVOTE AGAIN
He can become the mascot of reddit.  It's right there in the name.
Standard price for an 8th in CO (street price) is $50. Dispensaries charge around there, give or take $15 depending on quality.
Where I live, illegal weed is already $15/gram.
What a lazy Saturday afternoon. I'm with you on this one.
Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
If they don't, perhaps we should continue posting against b34nz, to spread the word. r/MJs reader count has gone down for three days in a row now, I think if more people knew then they would leave as well.
That's so expensive! Typical green in Toronto can be about a gram to 1.2 grams for $10 CDN. 
Also on LSD...  I've always known how far away the stars are, but when you look at them on LSD, you KNOW how far away they are, in the most awestruck way imaginable. Amazing stuff, that acid.
Yep.  It spread to the [mspsinttoday subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/mspainttoday/) already, with three submissions.  Since B34nz banned a lot of people on r/mspt I went ahead and banned him as well.  We don't need him posting any anti-Muslim picture.  
I thought it seemed too good/obvious to be true.   
unless those in power are those governed by reason and not emotion. gotta read that plato's republic :P
you *do* know his timezone.  post when he sleeps.  there's only one mod.  i haven't said a word since it happened, maybe because i was following /r/politics when it happened and noticed it months ago but i hope these trifector of subreddits really take off.  at least we'll know the die hard reddit0rs have migrated.
They probably don't get hot enough. It wouldn't be good if you could vaporize your hair by accident while you were straightening it.
voxcdn.com.  wtf is up with imgur.com? 
Voxel is Imgur's web host. I don't know why the URL is like that though.
For a second there I thought I opened something NSFW!  It used to happen to me, until I started taking the child safeties off my Bics, but it looks like you've already done that.
the URL was http://imgur.com/8GKI6.jpg but it redirected to the link i posted. 
yah, i pick up my bics on ebay in packs of 50 and remove all the safeties at the same time.  this is a first.  gf's fingers are still intact.
haha, this is what I look like right now. Coffee a bowl and now a cig. The trees know me so well.
Those people tend to not be dictators. I'll take my chances with a government elected by the people.
I think r/mj is very friendly but it's just b3anz that causes the unfriendly vibe now.
We want to remain professional. Spread the word, but do not spam. We are above him and his crap. Stay tuned. We're interested in the community.  - Coalition of Weedits
lol I used to get that from playing tennis. funny seeing you get that from a bic.
We're forming an organization that will lobby the admins as the face of the community called the Weedit Coalition. Stay tuned.
I've been smoking cigs a pack a day for 5 years now... I think my callus is permanent now :-/
cinsere is sincere. He mods the r/gonewild!
He's the bowser of their goomba castle.
The new custom style is very good. AND there is a REAL pineapple when you upvote! Pineapples for everyooonnneee....
I haven't really been bothering. I will definitely respond to people, and point them to content inside the coalition subreddits. But right now, what we really need is to work on building the organization. After we have the organization in place, we'll begin working on increasing the community. I will probably begin posting with my numbers at that time.   Just respond to peoples' comments with links to posts in the coalition. Spread the word and above all else contribute to the topics in our subreddits. We need to put up a strong presence quickly. 
That's what I was wondering.  How hot do hot knifes have to be? Do you have to use a gas heater to heat them up?  Is there any harm in trying? Would I be able to smoke the bud afterwards or would i just be wasting bud. 
hold the lighter between your thumb and index, striking with your index.  then hold only the fuel tab with your index finger.  no more burns!

Actually from my time on Reddit and experience on IRC sometimes having more mods can lead to the opposite of the desired effect. Traffic is so slow in /r/trees compared to /r/gonewild that it's a piece of cake. I just check the SPAM filter to make sure people's submissions don't get caught.
The hardest things in the world to clean. Still, that 6-chambered monstrosity near the end of the video literally left my mouth open.
Well hot knives get red hot. If the hair straightener didn't work, your bud would be fine.
quit using the fatty part of your thumb, use closer to the tip to get the best results, i used to get that, but adapted, use the edge near the nail, not the main pad.
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
using beeline would help, although its not as convenient
&gt;cinsere is sincere  you just blew my mind :0
Lots of wat moments in there
i don't think he's racist.
obvious troll is obvious
lol!  thanks man.
Yeah, that used to happen to me a lot d: I stopped leaving the child safety/I've started using matches a lot. 
yeah its about 60 on average here in NJ.
WOW! 20 bucks for a weak dub in NJ. 20! for what's usually about a .7! i need to get the fuck out of here...

This article is fascinating. I had read about Ruderalis as being the third species of the cannabis genus on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_ruderalis). I'm glad he's making a comeback!
People have been mix breeding Ruderalis into Indica and Sativa for a long time, this is how they created Low Ryder and Autoflowering strains.
That looks like a tasty bowl man... enjoy!
Irish coffee.
That looks delicious.
Gorgeous. And the piece is pretty nice, too.
b34nz is an asshole but to say he's "hell bent on the destruction of a people" implies that he has significant power to effect said destruction.  A billion Muslims are not going to be killed just because some loser stoner on the internet wants them dead
it's just so beautiful. T_T it makes me cry
Who cares about r/mj ? I like the look and feel of this place better... its a new beginning. Eventually he will lose too many people to other places, and then they'll boot him... either way ... let's just focus on making this place great !
Oh... yes!
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
I was banned for making an MSPAINTTODAY of it. I've never even been to r/mj, other than when my friend's on it (he smokes, I don't).  It's ludicrous!
Welcome.
Oh hey, Sunny D, all right!
I am looking - I am on my work computer today.
That looks like some fine weed my friend. 
Shit man, whereabouts do you live?
This picture was taken at the C.R. "Doodle" White overlook park in eastern Tennessee during a vacation. I live in Raleigh NC. 
Natural selection. Eventually the people with thicker fingers get high and procreate to create another generation who get high. It's the circle of life.
Ohhhhh I thought the picture was taken out on your back deck or something! Imagine living in a log cabin at that spot. Smoking a bowl every morning to that view.....man
I could deal with that. 
If you didn't know already weed is about 1/2 price in Canada relative to the US. (Not even accounting or the dollar)
Geez, I had no idea it was that bad. My heart goes out to you guys. 
Like anything by Carl Sagan, it's packed with amazing quotes.  Here's something that sticks out to me now: &gt;Cannabis brings us an awareness that we spend a lifetime being trained to overlook and forget and put out of our minds. A sense of what the world is really like can be maddening; cannabis has brought me some feelings for what it is like to be crazy, and how we use that word 'crazy' to avoid thinking about things that are too painful for us. In the Soviet Union political dissidents are routinely placed in insane asylums.  And here's one by Terence McKenna's "The Importance of Human Beings": &gt;I just saw a book and I pulled it off the shelf, a book about schizophrenia. And it said, "the typical schizophrenic lives in a world of twilight imagining, marginal to his society, incapable of holding a regular job, these people live on the fringes, content to drift in their own self-created value systems." That‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs it! Now I understand! We have no tradition of shamanism. We have no tradition of journeying into these mental worlds. We are terrified of madness. We fear it because the Western mind is a house of cards, and the people who built that house of cards know that, and they are terrified of madness. 
Well I'm a Torontonian too. Just letting ya know. Right now I got a decent hookup.
/r/cannabis doesn't seem to want us. They are more high brow and news focused. I think the name reflects that, and I have no desire to encroach upon their community. I think /r/weed would be the obvious name for the more casual scene that used to hang around /r/marijuana, but I am open to suggestion. Either way, keep the community informed and I will follow you. 
Yummy yum yum. That was way more awesome than I was expecting.
Nail trimming. Do you use it?
It's business as usual. Beanz just sits behind everyone spreading hate everywhere he can *except* weedit.
Fuck. I was too high to click that. I kept thinking it was one thread and got so confused.
oh god yes it was...

That is some very nice looking stuff my friend.

How about a more active one? Or maybe he lurks. Word of advice: Don't make me a mod, I wouldn't be a tyrant, but I do have a mean bark which could create a PR disaster. :)  By the way, I *LOVE* the design, man, way better than the old dictatorship. The link to NORML is a nice touch.
That subreddit seems to be under decent control, I'm sure /trees will be fine.
This would be so awesome. I always keep a look-out for someone sporting a Reddit shirt. It would be even cooler to spot a pineapple one.
Great looking buds, great looking pipe. Kudos to you!
I just fucking cleaned it. I know it's not big, but that bitch is durable. Dropped it a couple of times, it didn't break. I love that bowl, it just got me high! 
haha right on. Cheers!  I had to represent for NORML. They do good work.

I never knew!  I fucking love Reddit.  Always something new and awesome around the corner!
I don't know what to say.  Pineapple to you good sir!
It looks like a quality piece, and we all have our sentimental attachments to our hardware.  When my house was burglarized last year that was one of the things that pissed me off the most, i lost a piece similar to yours that had been a gift from an old friend.  That piece had got me high in about 20 different states form WA to CA to TX to FL.    Like yours, I know it wasn't valuable, you could find a nicer one in any decent headshop, and whoever stole it probably traded it for a single crack rock, but it can never be replaced and i miss it.   But in your pic, the hardware is a distant second place to beautiful scenery.  i have revised my score.  I think i was being unnecessarily harsh.
When i finally move to Raleigh, we are hanging out. =)

Maybe you are lighting too much man. I only flick that shit a couple times per bowl, it should stay lit in between.  Unless you just take a really long time to smoke a bowl I guess.
I don't know who you are, but you are *awesome.*
Dear kind sir / mam I would like 10,000 pineapples and build a castle from them and then eat the castle.
You are *slawsome*. Stank you very much.
It's peanna butta jelly time and nearly /r/trees 420 time. Readyy, aim, ignite...
If I give you 5 pineapples a day, it would take just under 5 1/2 years to get to 10,000.  That is a long time to wait.  :(
I am willing to wait as long as it takes.
Dank you for your impot. You seem like a good toke.   Uhh, I mean bloke.
You are a trooper.  I'll send some more your way.
Where I am it's only 1:20. Should I turn my clock forward a few hours?

Check out the number of subscribers :)
Oh shit. We need to get two more buddies in here.
I heard about it.  But then I smoked a bowl, realized it's just a sub-reddit.. and moved on with my life.  I was part of /cannabis and /marijuana before.. and I still am.    I think it's silly all the people posting in the other reddits about this.  I've said this elsewhere.. but I'll say it here too as I think this needs to be heard.  Beanz is just like a troll.  He posted shit to piss everyone off, horribly offensive stuff that would provoke anyone.. and now he's gotten us to all start new reddits and fill them with posts all about what a great troll he is.  Fuck.. he's the best troll I've ever seen on reddit.  Honestly, I think more of us potheads than this.  I don't see why we can't all just smoke a little herb, get over it, and just go back to filling the sub-reddits with interesting posts.. rather than some drama about a kid who desperately wants attention.    I guess I just don't see the point in giving him more attention.
The moment has happened.   420 subscribers...
Yayyyyyy  http://i.imgur.com/EkuyV.png

Okay... no one else subscribe... I want this moment to last forever.. lol
Damn, I missed it.... 421 now :-/
Yes. He's banned. It took much deliberation but the fact that he's holding /r/marijuana "hostage" and abusing his powers to such an extreme degree certainly put some weight on this outcome.
Alrighty then.  I like it better here anyway.  
I certainly don't have time to waste on some guy named b34nz. I'm busy with /r/trees. :D
Beautiful post man. Your words are true. 
Welcome.
Awesome, Thank You.
ooo.  a good post would also have been that you were busy with another kind of trees.
This is the best reddit ever.  It looks new, awesome, and the hivemind around here seems chill and friendly.  Well done!
those black bulges creep me out for some reason, like worms coming out of the bubbler *shiver*
It hits pretty good although I can't putt worth a fuck with it... sigh....
nicely spotted... :)
No. And I couldn't care less. I'm just gonna head to quieter grounds a la r/trees and r/stoner and r/weed. 
I can't help but laugh for referring to the incident as the 'b34nz ordeal'.

I really hate to burst your bubble, honestly I do, but it doesn't do any good.  Reddit detects mass downvotes by single users and they won't be reflected in karma scores.  But if it makes you feel better then by all means keep at it.  that guy is such tool.  I am positive that he masturbates to Abu Ghraib torture pics.
Look at that cute little [guy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Cannab2_new.png).

Black Holes blow my mind...  It's really interesting to think that there could be locations in space so dense that time is stopped.  It seems so similar to me as the idea of the big bang, before time existed and everything was incredibly dense.

He already tried. 
If you smoke twice a day for a month plus, about how long would it take to clear your system using this method?
Pretty much. HEY A PINEAPPLE!
lowryder is a hemp strain
The rule of thumb for regular smokers is a 30 day detox will more or less clean your system out. This method is useful for people who have a little time to prepare for the test. I have personally seen this method work with one week of abstention from marijuana. 
no way, my bud is too sticky
I cannot upvote this enough.
I go there from time to time and check the change in the number of subscribers.
That's way better than the [Euro Club](http://thegrip.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/the-euro-club-greatest-golf-club-ever/), you should be in those commercials.
This place is much more G2G.
I've actually almost downvoted all of his comments just by looking through reddits and downvoting / upvoting like I normally do (downvote shitty comments, upvote the good ones)
...some of that...
agreed.  It's fairly amazing that the amount of pissed off people doesn't warrant some action a bit higher up the reddit admin food chain
I always wanted to try this... I have never golfed but I'm an expert weed smoker.
I was looking at the wikipedia article, I saw the Indica and Sativa strains, but I was like, who is that little guy? I had never heard of him. 
Are you a cop?  The whole GreatestPigEVER kinda has me wondering...
HAHAHAHAHA
Download Vuze (formerly azureus). That's all.
naw. I have that and I do that, but if I want 1 track easy-peasy just googling      site:medifaire.net crookers   is so much better 
Ditto.
I banned him from the [mspainttoday subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/mspainttoday/) as well.
Cops Aren't allowed on Trees?
And no. 
Would your method hold up under a gcms test ? or,realistically, would any masking method ?
We all know what you MUST do. 
I came here to point out this section as well. It is a really good idea to write down your highdeas. I've gone as far as recording entire sessions, so as not to lose any possibly valuable information that might surface during that time. I've blown my own mind many times.
You're all welcome to join **and** submit, sorry about that.  Don't worry, B34nz is banned, and there are no down arrows.  Basically you just smoke a bowl, then draw anything you've seen on reddit.  It doesn't *have* to be drawn in MSPaint, you can use whatever you like, but it doesn't have to be professional in any way, such as people expect from Photoshop.  So, stop by, join, and submit.  We would love to have you.  
Wow, the middle is a pineapple!
This is going to sound clich√©. But my first advice is that you've absolutely got to walk around Vondelpark park. Don't worry about smoking in public. It's normal and nobody cares. Just use common sense. You'll also find the canals very nice but it can get packed with tourists especially anywhere within 10 minutes walking distance from the train station. The red light district is also fun to walk through if for no other reason then to gawk at the tourists ogling the women in the window and old men sheepishly trying to negotiate a price with the girls in their doorways, haha. Most importantly check out a few coffee shops don't just buy from the first one you see... compare prices and selection... or try a few out... and then make a decision. Most of them have excellent hash and hash is most recommended if you're traveling onward to France or Germany, etc.
If I may point out the last sentence, for those who didn't read the whole way through...  &gt;...the illegality of cannabis is outrageous, an impediment to full utilization of a drug which helps produce the serenity and insight, sensitivity and fellowship so desperately needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world.  ...From one of the greatest minds in history.
No, this will only work under preliminary testing. GCMS is waay too accurate to fool. The only way to pass GCMS is substitution. 
I'll be there next June. Vondelpark park ftw!

From a pm made public by cinsere, wingman187 seems to be behind r/trees now too. Perhaps he is the new mystery mod?  He seemed happy with the aesthetic redesign cinsere gave r/trees; but it is a shame none of the policies are changing under Cinsere, since they are what really needed to be changed. I mean, it wasn't a revolt against the css appearance of r/Marijuana after all.
HOLY.  FUCKING.  SHIT.  http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/shirt/9v59i/pineapple_shirts/  [EDIT:  Am I retarded or is the shirt link on every page?]

Speak for yourself! It's ALL about the css appearance, baby!   **VOTE PINEAPPLE/TREES 2012!**
I never realized that people didn't get arrested more often for weed brownies or other edibles.  Also, it freaks me out about the whole over night bag thing. I have always kept my stash in one of those when I was traveling.
lol upvoted omg
Not the mystery mod. I promise you that. 
I wanna go! :( Stupid work :P
Well autocrats usually have a pretty big ego, so maybe you should stroke his a little more and you might get your very own moderator powers here in this expanding subreddit. I wish you both the best of luck. I'd rather have the more reasonable tyrant, if I have to have a tyrant at all.
It's 1:15 in the afternoon where I am. But...I have the day off and I'm gonna head out on my deck to smoke a bowl and then watch *Smiley Face* with Anna Faris cuz that movie is silly. And I do so love The Silliness.
What exactly are these policies that need to be changed anyway? Sorry, I didn't follow the weedpolitics until the whole b34ns fiasco. What's the problem?
What does this have to do with pot?
http://imgur.com/0Xa9fl&amp;cRUyc  I got 2 pics on this page. The first one is the whole pipe, the 2nd is of the bowl...love those bubbles!  Got this piece on Salt Spring first week of fall. Went for 3 days of camping, weed, busking and LSD. Good times!  *I name all my pieces but have yet to name this one! Any suggestions?*
are you mad because he hasn't changed the description to link to the other subreddits? I don't understand, nothing really seems to be the matter here.
I read all of the comments, and it sounds like paranoia on the OP's part. I get that you are trying to prevent another b34nz fiasco, but IMHO I think that cinsere is doing a good job.   The second moderator is a mystery though, no doubt a second account created by someone. Servvit! why all the mystery? introduce yourself sometime
There's little transparency or oversight. I'm also concerned that the overall motive is to have status over a significant portion of the community for them. As was noted in b34nz's "I want to be a mod" thread, people seeking mod status aren't always the best people to be mod.   Cinsere is also taking power, because he sees the ability to take the power. That shows me he is power hungry. I am worried about r/trees for that reason. 
How do you propose introducing more oversight? Some kind of mod election or something?   I don't know,  just find it hard to seriously believe that someone's making a power-grab of an online pot forum. I don't know. As you can probably tell, I don't use the weed-related pages that much (and I think it's retarded that there's about 8 of them) so I'm not too invested in any of them. If you're right, then good luck.
I know it seems ridiculous, but a community on reddit of 18k+ is very enticing to a lot of people. It can be used as a resource like b34nz did using it as leverage, or it could just be a giant ego stroke. Either way, autocrats are dangerous to the community. They seize its collective resources to support their private agendas. Under a democracy of sorts, they would have to create unions between other autocrats of different persuasions. This ensures through the institution's architecture that the overall agenda will never be too radical, and usually will take the moderate stance of the public (the weedit community).
Well, I'm a little annoyed. I tried for two days to get him to do something tangible to support the coalition. All he was doing was supporting us in an odd comment here and there. When I tried to get him to put up a coalition component to his bar as demonstrated in all other coalition subreddits, he ignored me. This was yesterday! I bothered him over and over again, sent pm after pm, and only this morning when I pressed the issue did he finally back out. He sought to deceive us. He used us with the worst intentions to achieve his ultimate goal. He intended to withdraw yesterday when he initially ignored me, but used us to advertise this subreddit and instead ignored the situation as long as possible. Classic autocratic behavior, and autocrats are especially prone to becoming tyrants.  Now, he is wishing us the best of luck; but I don't buy the attitude. If he really was sincere, he would not have lead us on for days. ;) He is just masking his greedy little intentions. I don't care at this point. I give up. I'm throwing everything on the table, because I have nothing invested any longer and I am angry that he took advantage of the situation and the honest organization efforts of weeditors.  He's dangerous, even if I am a little paranoid.
I mad because he joined, then didn't do anything to support us. When we pressed him to do something tangible, he ignored it as long as possible (because we were advertising r/trees for him) and when he could stall no longer withdrew his bid.   I'm mad because he has made it clear he would prefer to be the sole owner of a new /mj than a member of a community run coalition. He made it clear he was only interested in growing this reddit. He made it clear he was not interested in elected mods, transparency, or oversight. He was only interested in his power and the number of people under it.  I am mad, because I have lost numerous hours of my invaluable time. I tried to help the community honestly, and I was rewarded with being used by a scammer. My time, which usually is sold for a high price to feed myself, is forever lost to a blackhole on weedit. I am mad, because my entire day yesterday and the sum of my efforts thus far have seemingly helped him get to where he is AND he still felt the need to be dishonest. I am mad, because I know he will succeed in replacing b34nz. He represents the status quo without the racist, xenophobic, homophobic slant--at least I hope. 
I don't get it.
:| really?
Yeah!  Try here http://www.reddit.com/r/p2p/  Trees is for "Discussion for growing and smoking little green trees. Or post pics of your beautiful trees. News and law should generally belong in /r/cannabis (suited for more serious discussion) but it can go in trees too. The more 420 conscious people.. the better."  You have used reddit before right?
lol okaye :thumbs up:
A little resin-y at the moment, but [here](http://imgur.com/aUI4R) you go.  I have to than you for posting this - if you hadn't, I would have continued to assume I had no weed left.  Imagine my surprise when I took out my piece to take a picture and discovered that there's a little bit left in there!  *Suggestions for names are also welcome.  Firefly was the closest it's come to having a name, since when I first got it the whole bowl glowed bright red while you hit it, but it stops doing that very quickly after it's been cleaned, so I more or less ditched that name.
alright, I upvoted just so I could see him post on this. I would like to see what is going on, but at long as there isn't excessive filtering / any banning I'll probably stick to r/trees because (1) I like the design and (2) the design and name are more work-safe than r/stoners (although, I'm currently subscribed to both)
[El Escarabeso](http://i.imgur.com/6C7yr.jpg)  It's got a finish like a beetle. Give it a kiss and it'll treat you well...
Okay. I will. :) Since I got a pirated copy of Windows though then I may need to use something else besides MS Paint.
I think lovethetrees asked /trees because he figured a bunch of fellow stoners would know... haha :)
Come on now. That's being a bit harsh don't you think? :p  But thanks for linking to /r/p2p... I never knew that it existed until now.
I used to work at a country club. Surprisingly, most all those guys doing maintenace work have college degrees in turf management.  And they all smoke pot. Sometimes, at work on the course. Trust me, mowing fairways is great when you're stoned.
Sorry if it sounded harsh, the voice in my head when i wrote it wasn't speaking harshly.
No worries mate.
I think we should plan a trip for a while out. You posted this two days in advance.. I've got a good job, but there's no way I could plan a trans-oceanic trip in that time...
This is incredibly well written.  Upvoted!! 
May I suggest the following additions:  While performing (2), decrease the amount of carbohydrates you take in during the mild exercise phase.  It will enhance the fat cell elimination of metabolites.  Think: induction part of the Atkins diet.  While performing (3), increase amount of carbohydrates eaten, in addition to creatinine-filled foods.  This will keep your body's metabolism from tapping into fat cells.

&gt;I mad because he joined, then didn't do anything to support us. When we pressed him to do something tangible, he ignored it as long as possible (because we were advertising r/trees for him) and when he could stall no longer withdrew his bid.  Dude, you advertised /r/potheads several times in /r/trees and I said nothing nor did I do anything because that's perfectly normal.  &gt;I'm mad because he has made it clear he would prefer to be the sole owner of a new /mj than a member of a community run coalition. He made it clear he was only interested in growing this reddit. He made it clear he was not interested in elected mods, transparency, or oversight. He was only interested in his power and the number of people under it.  &gt;I am mad, because I have lost numerous hours of my invaluable time.

To be honest that is my dream job.  Get baked and mow the fairways all day.  Outside, in the sun, free golf  whats not to love.  I've always suspected the maintenance guys are stoned.

In Canada we have Tim Hortons. If you get 'timbits', they're donut middles in boxes of 20 or so. If you get a 20 box or higher sometimes they don't even count how many they put in, they just fill it to the top and you get like 23 or 24.
Second. This album is so good I own two of it. Both are on 12" vinyl.
311 - From Chaos
Infected Mushroom - Converting Vegetarians... It was a long time ago :P
Fuck this drama, resolve this like adults.
As far as coffee shops, make sure you stop at Grey Area.  Their stuff is phenomenal every time I visit.
I worked at a country club over the summer and while I don't know about the maintenance people, I can tell you that pretty much all the caddies are high or have been drinking
double upvote for bacon and gorillas
&gt;I am however trying to act in the best interests of the community.  You're only looking out for *your* best interests. Someone should stop you.
BOARDS OF CANADA!!!  I can't recommend this band enough.  Every time I used to try a new drug, I would listen to [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrBZeWjGjl8). One time when I was tripping on ecstasy it brought me to tears :')
I like to do this but I only put the last 1/3 of the blunt in the bong
I fucking love the pineapples 
First time I got high was at a Dead show... right about when they covered Strawberry Fields
How did you want him to contribute?
You mean, you put the blunt in the downstem instead of a bowl? I don't get it.
&gt;There's little transparency or oversight  But you're the only mod of your senate subreddit. You need more mods now for credibility's sake. You keep calling cinsere power hungry, but what about you? How can the rest of us trust either of you?  I'm just trying to be as non-biased and impartial as I can be.
Radiohead - In Rainbows. Nude, specifically.  Although I do enjoy myself some Dub/Dark Side of the Moon.
Yeah, that whole album is pretty unique. Groove on it for hours...
All he should do it put up links. He doesn't have to follow a special little format, that's taking it too far.
For me, honestly, it might take away from the charm of the blunt.  Blunts lend themselves to some stylish smoking.  French Inhales.  Shotguns.  The thing you do where you puff out a thick cloud just to suck it back up again.  Also, I imagine blunt smoke through a bong, even through one with sophisticated hardware filtering mechanisms, would be harsh like hell.  This is merely speculation however, I'm yet to try this smoking method.  Cheers!  EDIT: added one phrase for clarity
Radiohead - The Bends  It was 1995 and I was in 8th grade.  Holy crap I feel old now.
what Defualt said
Same here.  I love the small subreddits.
I'm pretty sure it was Wu-tang and I was hanging out in Kansas City with some members (they said they were but I don't know) of [ms 13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_Salvatrucha) they were really cool and then I asked if we could watch a bruce lee movie and we did. It was great.
you must be high.
First, invest in a good book: [The Bible](http://www.marijuanagrowing.com/dhtml/books_bible.php), by Jorge Cervantes. All your questions will be answered there.  Decent lights for dank buds are going to cost a lot more than $200, brother. But if you're just going with CFLs, invest in good seeds, and I suggest soil, not hydro.
This is the first piece I bought, her name is [lexy](http://imgur.com/vA5ty).  And this is [my bong](http://imgur.com/SQu5o) Madeleine (left) and her sister (roomates bong) Symphony, on the right.
I made a simple light fixture using a bathroom light strip with 4 sockets, 4 Y-splitters, and 8 CFLs. Worked pretty well, and it was under $80 too.
&gt;I'm under the impression that cinsere was just scamming the coalition to get us to advertise his subreddit. He agreed to be apart when r/cannabis was a prospective member,   You had no problems posting several links to your subreddit. In fact, that has been the only thing you've contributed to [/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees) except the thread where you're personally attacking me because [/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees) has more subscribers than yours. Sorry to say, but it's time for you to grow up.  &gt;but declined membership when asked to commit with standardization.  This is incorrect and you know it. I declined membership when you wouldn't stop sending me messages demanding that I comply to every one of your whims.  &gt;He appears to be ambitiously set on replacing r/marijuana with r/trees, and wants to encompass our other subreddits' purposes and users.  Listen to yourself. Does this even make any sense? No.   It certainly doesn't reflect reality or any sort of action I've taken. I know that [b34nz](http://www.reddit.com/user/b34nz) hurt you very deeply, but I think you should realize that you've gone off the cliff, that you've drank your own Kool-aide, man.  &gt;He does not appear committed to our ideas of transparency and oversight.   Is this why you threatened to remove me from /r/weeditsenate because it sure seems so.  &gt;He has begun modding random people unknown to the community. I'm afraid he is just a more reasonable b34nz 2.0.  This statement is just inaccurate. In another thread you just called me a "racist". A few minutes later you retracted this insult. But it just goes to show that you will say anything to make me into b34nz even though I haven't done a damn thing that deserves that sort of comment.  &gt;What does this mean for the coalition?  Face it, dude. The coalition is mainly *you*. It's *you* reaching for power. It's *you* abusing people and threatening to remove them when you don't get your way.  &gt;We have only two subreddits (and the senate.) Roughly about 200 readers.  This is the problem. You are envious for power. I can't seem to figure out your motives. Everything is so competitive for you. I'm not a competitive person. I just want to chill out with friends, get high, and discuss fun stuff.  &gt;I am too tired and overworked to put up a second fight against cinsere.  You have launched personal attacks against me in several different sub-reddits. It's alright though because I'm not going to let it ruin my weekend. I'm still having fun at my mate's house in the countryside getting high.  &gt;It is a shame, but I am inclined to let the coalition fall and let cinsere become another autocrat in the community.  Note to community: I removed myself as moderator 12 hours ago from /r/potheads. I am not an autocrat otherwise I wouldn't have removed myself. Furthermore, I added a link to NORML to the front page of [/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees). They do good work and I wanted to do something good for the goal of legalization.   Finally, I think it's time to put an end to this childish bickering. I'm sure that the whole Weedit community has had enough. Fo' real. All of the mods (you, CuntSmellersLLP, wingman187, whatoncewas, and myself) are creative and ambitious people who hold the best interests of the Reddit Weedit community at heart. Don't forget that.  &gt;Unless someone else steps up, I'm just going to let the cards fall as they are falling.  In the end, we have much more in common than we do differences. We're all redditors. We're all stoners.  I care about you that's why I'm having this intervention.
2112 - Rush
Yeah, you can use a bong as a roach clip sorta.
Woah, are you a kiwi?
http://zombo.com/
&gt;The idea was to create cohesiveness through the network. If you weren't aware, I initially wanted to call it the weedit network. Wingman187 created the Coalition of the Weedits, so it changed to weedit coalition.  In another thread you're attacking wingman187.  &gt;We just want to share traffic and promote the network as a whole. He was content with the arrangement as long as we advertised his subreddit, but the only one he linked back to was one not even associated with us.   This is false again, dude. You keep posting the same rubbish. You've been trying to siphon off the traffic of /trees by posting links to your own sub-reddit. I don't mind. But don't go and accuse me of not allowing you to post links and trying to grab traffic from the 10 subscribers to your sub-reddit and stoners is not fair.  &gt;He was only interested in growing his group, which is against what we stand for and why we left r/marijuana. Why should we trade the same with more of the same?  Blah blah blah... We've been doing this exchange for days. I've spend three days working on /trees for the good of the community. Nothing else. I was galvanized to set-up a stable replace for /r/marijuana once the moderator from /marijuana lost his marbles.  Mind you, if you don't believe then please check my history. I moderate /r/gonewild and this sub-reddit is drama-free and very well managed. I enjoy doing it because I love watching the community grow like little trees. :)  &gt;Why should we trade the same with more of the same?  This isn't 2008 and you're not Barack Obama. I'm sorry to inform you.  
&gt;That doesn't necessitate that my product will be superior, but perhaps that is what you are perceiving.  Then why do you do the things that you hate? Hmmm? Grabbing for power, abusing your power, and starting drama to name a few.
You jerk.

Well, there are many, many different brands of fertilizer out there.  NPK is usually listed as a number formatted like this: #-#-#  These numbers are percentages, so if a fertilizer has 10% Nitrogen, 20% Phosphorous and 10% Potassium (often listed as "Potash"), the number on the product will look like this: 10-20-10 -or- 1-2-1.  As for the salts and micronutrients (Magnesium, Iron, Zinc, etc), these will also be listed on the bag, most likely along with the NPK information on the side/back of the bag.    As for molarity, I nearly failed Chemistry in high school...
Miles Davis - Kind of Blue
The first time I got high was actually at a Tool concert (Laturalus tour). Get ready from some stoner recollection (I'm baked and listening to tool now).  It is still by far one of the best experiences of my life. I bought the tickets for myself and my highschool best friend (a girl I was seriously crushing on- ah highschool) within minutes of them going on sale and managed to get pit 'seats' (it was general admission). We got their ridiculously early and managed to get right up to the stage. Before the show and between the opening act (Tomahawk, who actually ended up being booed of stage- they really were awful) we ended up chatting with some people who had been to like five tool shows already (a number I am almost embarrassed to admit I've reached).  If you haven't been to see Tool, well, its the most amazing thing every. For this show (and they're all different) the lights went completely dark and then a glow (black lights) appeared on stage- the baseline for Sober starts and the band (minus Maynard) comes out with glowing instruments. Then a spotlight appeared behind stage silhouetting Maynard as the lyrics started. And that was just the first two minutes- part way through the back drop changed to this very trippy screen that had black lights and red spotlights moving over it which caused the design to completely change on those spots.   So I'm standing there, arms around my friend holding onto the barrier in front of the stage, the band is literally right in front of me, and the people I met beforehand are lighting up the joints.   And so began my life as a pothead.

Modest Mouse's "Good News for People Who Love Bad News," my favorite album of all time just got better because of weed
I love it when I'm out for dinner and it's better than I expected. Recently took a friend out for a prime rib dinner and it was sooo much tastier than I expected. Awesome tender beef, garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. Yum!
hahaha, that's perfect. Listened to it for a while

Welcome to Zombocom!
movie critics suck each others cocks so much that they actually hallucinate from the arrogance levels in their man-juice causing a distorted perception of what happens in movies
I never really listened to albums straight through until about 3 or 4 years ago.  So the first album I listened to in its entirety while baked was just a couple years ago. It was in a very small cellar (only big enough for a small couch) that was converted into a smoking room. It had a record player. Me and my friends listened to Abbey Road and smoked a vaporizer for the first time. It was also only lit by christmas lights... that was awesome.
LOL  Totally :P

agreed.  Celestia rocks!   I would get so baked and pretend I was flying the millennium falcon in hyper-drive flying through the universe.

Dude...that was a wicked album! People look at me like I'm nuts when I tell them I was toking up in Jr High. I don't see the issue...I grew up with it. 
Roger Waters, The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.  Fuck I'm old!
It was a movie, not a soundtrack. The original Halloween. In retrospect...not so great to toke up to when you're 13 and already paranoid about maniacal killers in the darkness.
Ghost inhale.
I smoked the day before an unexpected drug test. I smoked a lot. But my tester looked at the results, said "that's fine," and quickly tossed them in the trash. Fuck did I get lucky!  Anyway, good tips. I've been wondering if my results were actually negative though. Do you know if an oral swab is significantly less accurate than a urine test? I got this less than 24 hours after smoking. I was panicking, and I was never told whether it was positive or negative, just "fine."
Lots of people do it, RooR even makes a [special bowl](http://www.everyonedoesit.com/online_headshop/Roor_Spliff_Adaptor.cfm?iProductID=1585) for it.

[Electric Wizard's Dopethrone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77uVmkb6oes), fucking awesome.  
Good luck man, growing weed is awesome :) .... You can probably get away with only three pot sizes, two types of nutes (one for flower one for veg, although three may work better), you can pick up a ph testing kit pretty cheap (its a test tube and indicator solution that you use to measure the ph of the feed solution and the run off, costs around $10-$15) then adjust the level with household items (vinegar, baking soda), a thermometer is also pretty essential, heat builds up even with cfls and it will kill your plants. Do try to max out your entire budget with quality items though, the more cash you spend now the less cash, time and seeds you will waste later
yes yes yes
Nice ;) I hadn't heard of this before and will definitely try it some time.
Rice Krispies + Sugar is the most fulfilling cereal of all time. I'm so glad other people eat it.

The G-sides is where it's at. I listen to that a lot. 
They wrote their own language called "hopelandic" for the () album...That blows my mind...also their documentary called "Heima" is incredible. If you haven't listened to that album, or seen that documentary I recommend it.

I wish my first time was Wu-Tang
yeah, wish there was one around here... hate to say it because i feel corporate, but they are funny, and they arent as overplayed as others... or as stupid ( ie mcdonalds, taco bell etc) When I first saw this on tv my girlfriend and I were watching it on a dvr and she didnt believe there was a bowl in the front window of the van, so we had to rewind it and pause ... again at the expense of sounding corporate ... technology kicks ass

Bruce Willis was dead the entire time.
mmmmmmmmmmmmm...... anyone know which strains turn out like this?... I see lots with awesome color in the flowers but not many that produce such colorful buds
Either way really, depends on size of slide, downsteam, bowl, and blunt.  We normally wedge the blunt into the slide so it's airtight, and you can pull the slide up to clear it, like a normal bong rip.
hampton comes alive by phish
This is good advice and it makes sense.
Put it in the bank until you can afford a decent setup.
kinda disappointed about that... while i agree with whoever it was who said "his ways are not the ways of a stoner"  I thought the main grip was that he went mad banning people who didn't agree with him and whatnot... banning him appears (to me at least) to be exactly what he would do in the same situation (less the hateful remarks)...  if b34nz has thought us anything it is that banning people for their conduct elsewhere and or personal reasons is not the way of a stoner 
Watch the "I Grow Chronic" series on Youtube. Hilarious video with a lot of useful info for the everyday grower that's not looking to drop 2 grand on a setup.
I put the holes in the trees. 
happy someone finally said it :)
As others have said, I would save it until you get up to at least $500.  100W for your first plant, and 50W thereafter is the guideline I follow for lighting.  However, if you can't wait. Then go for multiple CFLs adding up to as high as you can. I would mount them to something that you can move, so you can place them as close to the plant as possible, moving them as the plant grows.  pH is very important, it effects nutrient uptake in the plant, too many Nutes and your plant will get dehydrated and you end up with Nute Burn (brown/yellow spots and blotches) too little Nutes and your plant will shut down and stop growing.   You want a pH between 5.1 and 5.9, I kept mine at around 5.2-5.3.  pH meters aren't that expensive, but if you ever want to get into hydro, then you will also want a TDS/EC meter, you can get pH/TDS/EC meters for about $125 on eBay (Hanna Meters).  I have only ever grown hydro (recirculating aeroponics), my 16 plant setup cost me $650 total. 
if its just for one plant you may want to check out the idea of growing in a pc case, more specifically a server case. it lets you maintain the environment for your plant very well, and growing with cfl's is completely possible. as a added bonus its only going to cost you $100ish
that was strange.
hopelandic has been used on more albums but () is the only one that is all hopelandic. in interviews they have said it's just gibberish. when they write songs before they have any lyrics he just sings and sometimes they leave it like that.
You should get on the irc channel. 
I trust you guys enough to tell you this...  I have NO fucking clue what IRC is, or where to find the channel.  :(

Check out the description bar over there to the right.   But first, you need to download an IRC client, like babbel or something like that.

Welcome. Choo-Choo-Choose you too.
Yeah man same here. First step is to get together again. I knew this whole coalition thing would hurt us. Glad to have you here, I enjoy your drawings... I actually have the one with the stoned-as-fuck alien on the bottom left-hand corner and "weedit" in the middle as my background. It's awesome.
The easiest way to get on IRC is via the web through this web site: http://webchat.freenode.net/  From there it's simple. You choose any Nickname and where it says Channels enter: #weedit  Click the Connect button. Then you're there.
*fades in from the shadows*  I just want to tell you both good luck. We're all counting on you.   *fades out*

Thanks for stepping up and taking the time to give that asshat what for.  I'm in. 
If you go on irc the coalition doesn't look like an asshole. However you are nitpicking so much I really doubt you smoke pot regularly. 
Eh, what? Nitpicking? Anyway, yes I do smoke pot regularly. Almost every day in fact. MIND BOGGLING, AIN'T IT!?!
Watches in disbelief as someone who is standing against a wall turns around and says something and then turns back and puts his coat up as if he is hiding.   *Grandmas Boy* comes to mind best.   ;)

*internet high five*  Wait... What were we...   Oh look, shiny!
it's not about a book being better than reddit.  it is about being independent and not relying on somebody else.  $200 is skimpy.  where do you plan on growing?  if you need a cabinet, that could easily be 200 bucks.  i've setup 4 guys now with a grow.  the startup costs are 1000-1200, plus about $50/month in electricity.  after 3 months you will have 20+ ounces and depending where you are geographically, that will be 3-4x your original investment, with everything paid off.  for 200 bucks though, go grab a couple light fixtures, go on a hydro site and buy some CFL bulbs with the correct spectrum, go to home depot and get some crap miracle grow and pots; then maybe you'll have 50 bucks to spare on something better than bagseed.  you get what you put into it.  
Pics?  Where?  :D

It depends on what kind of country club it is. Mine's full of old people, so they're all kinda plastered but I don't think many of them are stoned (though I know a couple of guys have rolled around with a blunt before).   The high school teachers that play out there, they're all stoned though.

an old bootleg cd called Opium Den (Tool).  I actually thought I was hearing satan, then later realized that it was a wicked effect on maynard's voice.
Yeah it's a little annoying, actually. I like how everything else looks, though. :D  By the way, what was the verdict on the points = joints ordeal? Is it feasible?
Nitpicking is a funny word.  What's a Nit and how the hell would I pick it if I indeed found it?  Far-fuckin-out man.

When I roll a blunt, it is because I wanna smoke a blunt.  When I load a bong, it is because I wanna take a bong hit.  Except the roach often gets split open and loaded into the bowl for the period at the end of that sentence.
NPR won't stop jizzing about it.  literally every single show has run something about how great it is.  i just wish they hadn't made the ad campaigns directly to hipsterish aesthetically minded young people.  I feel like I'm being catered to and thats exactly what i hate.
Nice holes!
I know exactly what you mean. I just had to see it though. It's such a big part of my childhood. I *loved* that book when I was a kid. But, yeah, I hate being pandered to as well.
Go to your local hydro grow shop to learn up.  As far as individual brands go, YMMV and it's not possible to give a conclusive assessment.  If you're willing to buy stuff, the guys at the grow shop will be willing to teach you.

i have experience in soil mostly, but i've also grown with hydro, soiless, and aero.  an enclosure could have been your whole budget, which is why i started recommending CFL's and miracle grow. (btw- not all miracle grow is shit, just most of it.)  i would recommend this spending about $75 on a grow CFL of about 150-200 watts.  besides your seeds this will be your biggest investment.  you can pick up a desk oscillating fan at office depot for about $30.  there are lots of good breeders, but chimera has great seeds for the price, i would recommend looking into what he has available these days.  regarding transplants, start your seeds with the paper towel method then plant them in dixie cups with holes in the bottom.  transplants are kinda important because if you plant something in a large pot the roots will go to the outside of the pot, down the sides and take up the bottom, leaving the mass of the soil in the middle without roots.  i use cheap dixie cups, then go into my final pot, usually 3-5 gallons.  for soil i would recommend picking up some fox farms ocean forrest and mixing this with about 1/3 perlite or vermiculite.  for pH, go to an aquarium store and pick up one of those drop testers.  should be less than 5 bucks.  the soil is pH'd pretty well with dolomite and others and will also have a decent amount of nutrients in it, enough to last you through veg and part way through flower.  however you will need to pick up a quart or so of a good organic bloom nutrient.  there are lots available, but i recommend pure bloom pro blend for about 20 bucks.  * light + fixture = $75 * soil + perlite = $30 * cup and 3-5gallon pot = $5 * fan = $30 * seeds = $60 * nutrients = $20  * total $120  i've gone slightly over budget but the last $20 wont be needed for a month or so.  i would also imagine you might be able to find a cheaper light or cheaper seeds from another breeder to keep you within budget.  i was also going to send some seeds to another guy from weedit that wanted to do a breeding project.  i had an OG Kush throw some nanners on the lower branches and i used the pollen to 'paint' a couple seed areas on some green crack, blue dream, grape ape and blackberry bubba kush.  if you are interested i may be willing to share a couple.  maybe.  :)  good luck.  happy growing.
I've done it and its fun just cause i can be like fuck yeah i have all these options at my disposal but im gonna combine them! But as for the actual practicality of it, it dont really add anything but it is good when the blunt is gettin low to put it in so you dont burn your fingers and you can smoke the whole thing 
What are the other ones? This is the only JitB stoner commercial I know of.
I used it at the end with one friend. Smoke the blunt, about 20% left and then we put that in the bong. Nice few last hits
Wow, to be in your shoes, hearing DSotM without knowing every single chord, snare, and vocal.  I envy you.
I have no technical knowledge of how CSS works, but if they changed "readers" to "stoners" next to the front page button, changing points to joints would not be too hard. 
How was it my friend? Good tree?
&gt;Is this because there's a certain light that can do wonders for both veg and flowering  i think so, so long as we are referring to CFL's and not other types of floros like a T5.  i have very little exp with CFLs, i only use them to root clones.  i've seen the T5's have a cool and warm bulb (3000k versus 6500k) , but the CFL's seem to have a full range spectrum in every bulb.  perhaps somebody with more CFL exp can shed some light. (pi)  &gt;Those seeds of yours sound absolutely delicious. What would it take for you to part with something so beautiful?  me to not be so damn lazy.  or maybe me to stop with the wakey wakey eggs n bakey on a regular basis.  or maybe...what was i talking about again?
I just take Diamox. Maybe its because I'm lazy, and won't show up in the test as a cleaner.   Diamox is probably never sold as cleaners though, I'm just lucky to have a prescription.
What'd you do first?
It was brilliant. My second trip and things were a little different due to the introduction of smoking laws but other than that it was Amsterdam.  The tree was also very good. I tried as many varieties as possible.
you could very likely get away with just the bloom bulb.  i use HPS for veg.  the plants know their stage of life mostly by the amount of light/dark they get on a 24 hour cycle.  i was checking out [this](http://www.bghydro.com/BGH/itemdesc.asp?ic=HLIFCFD200FB&amp;eq=&amp;Tp=) one.  i noticed in the description that said it provides the full spectrum that plants require.  
After landing I got a train. Didn't score until after I had checked in. Fortunately I was met at the train station by my brother who had already rolled one for me.
this is a very chill new subreddit, it gets my vote! (and smoke)
WELCOME, TO THE WOOOORRLLLD OF TOMORROW!!
Never been to Cali but I have been to B.C. (Canada) and have sampled some of their finest fare and I would tend toward Amsterdam. In the main for variety, as such I could score mild weed or the strongest indicas and sativas and also some very good hash.  
his words humbling and beautiful at the same time, we can all learn a lot from this great man of science.
fyi, soil and hydro ph ranges differ greatly.  5.2 wouldn't be very good for soil.  here's a good reference.  http://www.gardenscure.com/420/attachments/soil-ph/169274d1138144376-ph-nutrient_chart.gif 
(space marine) WHOSE IN CHARGE HERE!?!?!   i think it should be you Yoshiler, your attentiveness and love of mj has inspired me!
Space Marine!? Cool! My dad always said I was a space cadet. we're liek twinz, lol!  Btw, [cinsere](http://www.reddit.com/user/cinsere) is in charge.   EDIT: Until I stage an uprising and coaliticize his ass, that is.
Kid A. However I essentially got high to that album before I smoked pot anyway.
Did you encounter a lot of people toking in public? Meet anyone?
How expensive can all the smoking get and the trip in general? I'm considering going (currently studying in the UK), but I wanna financially plan ahead.
Yes, quite a few. As you cannot smoke inside some places many people were wandering around with J's.
Saw Mike this last weekend in Sacramento. Best show I've seen in a long time.
It can be expensive, especially given the weak pound. If you want to make the most of your money I would avoid the red-light district for weed and shroom purchases.  Get a tram from Central-Station to Rembrandts-Plein or Leidse-Plein, both of these will have some coffee shops that are easily found and will sell good bud at a decent price. It is also a nicer area to stay but not sure how accom. prices compare with the RL district.  If you are in the RL district there is a coffeeshop called 'The Old Place" which is just by the old church at the top of the RL district. This also does good, reasonably priced gear. I had some awesome G-13 from this place. 
Uprising by politicising and coaliticising. I'm in.
No way! I didn't even notice. haha
I love Carl Sagan. I did even before I knew he blazed.
So what would you say you spent on a daily average just for smoking?
Becks Mellow Gold.
Haha, it was actually a reference to "Airplane," but I'll pineapple you for the Grandma's Boy reference.  DUDE, YOU JUST GOT PINEAPPLE'D!
This is a sample of what I purchased:  1.4g G13 ‚Ç¨14  1.5g White Widow ‚Ç¨8  2g AK47 ‚Ç¨15  1.7g NYC Diesel ‚Ç¨12 
Stopping power... I like it
LOOLLLLLL, yeah!
fucking incredible
I felt like I was on extremely potent hallucinogens when I saw Radiohead live last summer. I was just stoned.  Fucking incredible music. 
"The Moon and Antartica" 
Led Zep IV. so typical
HAHA! Yes, I remember now. You get a pineapple to!
Psssssh. That's nothing. Those prices are way better than what I'd get on the streets in Chicago.  Thank you very much for all this info. Now I got high hopes for Amsterdam, my friend. High hopes.
The problem is "XYZ points" is in the same span so it's not a simple matter of replacing it with "joints." I think the only way to do it would be to place a floating image on top of it that says "joints" so long as you can right align it.
how much did you smoke?
There isn't anything like 'normal' weed in The Netherlands. By normal I am assuming just average weed you pick up off a dealer. Due to the laws weed is sold by strain/variety name. As such the strength will vary from strain to strain but the seller can usually tell you what sortof high the bud encourages.  Edit: normal weed would be the sort of bud of unknown lineage that most of us get from our dealers.
aw damn! I made them big. What is your scenario? Why are you using compact mode?  I'd take a look right now, but I've demodded myself from my test subreddit lol. So I can't tweak unless I become a mod here, or start a new subreddit and build it again. 
Interesting. That would be really hard wouldn't it. 
Whered you see them?
You demodded yourself from your test reddit? XD
I can attest to this. My brother lives in the Netherlands nd when he comes to Canada and I smoke him some, he's usually quite impressed. 
It's hilarious, I know. hahahah I wanted to see if you could delete yourself, and if you could undo/choose to become the mod of said subreddit.   Needless to say, there is no return. it is a barren wasteland of css.
That's pretty funny. I've create some vector stuff if you want to use it. I've got a vector based weed leaf and a pretty basic bag of weed. You interested? 
For the best return on your money, spend the bulk of your funds on lights. The number of lights required depens on your room size. A 600w HPS light will get pretty hot in a cupboard but is perfect for a small room. One if the benefits of a big light is crop maximisation. 1 or 2 good sized plants under a HPS will yield considerably more than under CFL's. Not to knock CFL's, I have tried using them, whilst great for vegging and clones they lack the ooomph required for flowering. 
Rather a lot, but I could not give you a quantity, I was with my brothers and we were all buying and smoking.
Vector is the only way to go!  Hey man I'll take whatever you want to give. I'll be building a "reddit master vector" file. 
I've had a lot of weed in both places.  Dutch weed is consistently really good.  American weed is a lot more variable.  I usually get really good weed here in the states, but that has a lot to do with who I know and where I live.  I've gotten plenty of weed here that is not up to Amsterdam standards.
Word 
The problem is this:  	.score.likes {  		background-image:url(%%pineapple%%); 		width:25px; 		height:19px; 		background-position:center;  		background-repeat:no-repeat; 	}  So the same div that colors the score, and produces the pineapple, is applied to the # of points.   I haven't had a chance to look at my css until now, and until I get remodded in r/lovesthetrees I won't be testing/fixing.  **its inconvenient I know, I'm sorry I'll fix it**  
I could change points to joints no prob. wait until I get back up and running ;)
I'll look into it no worries. 
I thought I was paying a lot when I was in Australia, shwag was just about free and those breeds were always cheaper than that. Harder to find though.
Compact mode also causes some kind of weird artifact to appear to the right of the arrows after upvoting/downvoting. I have no idea what it's supposed to be, but it's annoying nonetheless.  I'm certainly not going to switch to the gimped digg-alike layout just to amend this.

Do you think that it is the same way over in ireland, england, scotland?  My dream is to go golfing over there, but have always wondered where to score some kind when i get there. 
I think California weed is fantastic, simply because of the permissive nature around cultivating, distribution, and possession. Thus, some reggies that someone in San Francisco buys would be way better than, say, reggies in Atlanta, GA, or Madison, WI.  That said, I've had regular (commercial, "mersh", reggies, whatever) from Cali, the Deep South (aka, Mexibrick), and from Vancouver, BC, and by _far_ BC reggies are superior. That street-scored weed made me literally cross-eyed and comatose after like 1/3rd of a bluntful. It's probably the highest I've ever been, and all because I just _knew_ that it couldn't be powerful stuff if it was scored off the street. I was wrong.  I can't imagine what Amsterdam weed would be like.

Those are going to be lovely trees when they get older full of nice sweet-smelling buds. Thanks for sharing.
Maybe it's because I'm a heartless bastard stuck in my conservative old-layout browsing ways, but I think the whole "pineapple" thing is fucking stupid.
its out of focus, its right next to it, in profile. 
I sent you a message.
It reminds me a little bit of the old IRC days.
/trees &lt;3 you.
The funny thing is that I don't even have thumbnails on (it can be disabled under Preferences). So I'm one of those people in /r/marijuana who didn't even get the whole pineapple reference until someone explained it slowly to me.
Well I think that's sucking ftupid.
Pineapple for you!
Thumbnails? I wasn't even aware reddit had added such a feature. Goodness.  I guess I must have disabled them on the day they were added...
Your brother knows how it's done. 
Ok, reason not to read while high: I read that as "Just wanted to show you some pics of my young PANTS"  I basically clicked out of curiosity. Which I guess was the point of the post but inspired by a very morbid sense of humor.
Who doesn't love Michael Jackson?   That's really no reason to put anyone in charge.

Are you talking to me? Or cinsere?
Normally I wouldn't argue against the whole fuck-it and smoke a bowl route.  However, and with all due respect, your post seems to be of the "too cool for school" variety.    I'd argue he's not a troll.  A Troll gets its thrills from eliciting responses.  Beanz' feelings are hurt so he's going to take his ball and go home, everyone else be damned.  He's hijacked a beloved thread with 18k subs and is silencing any and all dissent.  Granted with that clown at the helm the r/mj sub was probably doomed regardless.  However, the majority of posts I've seen regarding the banning and deleting of posts on r/mj seem to have a legitimate gripe.   (PS- I tried your advice, three times actually, and I "still* think Beanz is an asshat.) 
No offense but screw the "Coalition".  I don't have the time, short term memory, or small motor skills necessary to navigate eight weedits just so every MOD feels they are a part.    r/trees is my vote.  Kats seem pretty chilled out over here. 
Not to mention what he's done with the drapes.  A man could get really get stoned in here.
He smokes?! Whhhhaaatt? Awesome, just awesome.
The look awesome. Is this your first experience growing, do you have friends that grow or is this your first hands on experience?  They really do look fantastic, I can tell you pretty careful with this and clean etc.
Read the dude's posts.  He's the only one involved in all of this drama that I can imagine smoking a bowl with.
Yes this is my first experience growing and I don't know anyone that grows. I got laid off from a job and was looking for something to do, so I build a cabinet set up. Though I haven't actually finished building it. The interior of the flowering chamber still needs to be set up.
It depends on where you live in the U.S. My friend/dealer just pushed some Cali Kush and some OG Kush that was pretty dank, and he just picked up some Sour D straight from NY which he says is so dank. And my friends have been to Michigan, Virginia, Maryland, and they say all they smoke there is like shitty mids. We got the dank here in Boston son.
Well I'm very sorry if I offended you, and I actually wasn't aware that the coalition had been dissolved. I unsubscribed from those subreddits.  But I do not take back what I said about the impossible demands. You guys seem to have realized this now and dissolved it. What do you guys plan on doing now? Would you be joining us at /r/trees? I'm sure anyone (but b34nz) is welcome here. I really just want us to join in one subreddit to replace Weedit. Splitting it up so many ways splits Weedit apart. So... I hypothetically pass you the peace pipe.  Yes, I'm high now. 
Hope you got the  audio tour at the VanGoh (sp?) museum.

No, those are sunglasses.

Yeah man, he was a big pothead apparently. In the 1970's he released articles anonymously about cannabis.
How did you get yourself on the plane to come back?
maybe it wasnt this one, either way it was a jitnb commercial and there was an out of focus pipe on the dash ... 
I've had strains from both and Amsterdam is the clear winner.
if i were you i would be hoping for a girl
Sounds awesome. I can't wait to see the finished setup and of course the fresh and dried buds at the end :D
Haha, yeah. Dunno why I addressed it as a he. They're from feminized seeds so I hope that gives me better chances of it being female.

Is that where you bought the seeds? That's expensive!!!
I live in the bay area in California, and since high school the weed I've gotten has been dank purps for .7-.9 for $10
I thought it totally stunk! I get that the various wild things were different sides of the young boy's personality, and some of the interaction between himself and the wild things enabled him to be less egocentric and see how he was being a total dick to his mom, but there was just too much of nothing going on. I thought the music was well suited for the film however.   
I hate to be a Negative Nancy, but you should come back to earth for a minute.    Banks are loathe to loan to individuals for this type of endeavor without SERIOUS collateral.  Especially in this current economic climate.  In the area you are talking about, real estate is pretty pricey, so you are looking at a lot of debt.    You better have serious cash reserves because even successful bars/restaurants have huge start-up costs and always bleed cash for a long time before becoming profitable.  If you can't afford to lose money for a year and still stay in business you are looking at almost certain failure even if it is a kickass bar and I come with all my friends and get drunk every weekend.  What happened to the restaurant that was there before? and why are you so special that you can succeed where they failed?  Do you have a thoroughly researched and fleshed out business plan including marketing research and cost estimates?  You better have good answers for these questions because anyone who might possibly lend you money is gonna ask them, and a lot more too.  All that said.  I encourage you to pursue it.  At a minimum do some research answer the above questions for yourself, and come to your own conclusions.  "You can't succeed if you don't even try", and all sorts of other boring cliches about pursuing your dreams.  If you get there, I will come in and buy a round or six.  I promise.
After you make sure to understand that most small businesses fail, and after you realize that real life isn't like the movies and if you go bankrupt, you will be paying for this for a long, long time.  After all of that... if you are still willing to take the jump... then call yourself an entrepreneur and be proud to live with the consequences of your decisions and I wish you the best.

They don't just line the canals, they line every street, every square, every available space. Outside the main train station there is a multiple-story carpark for bikes. Probably in excess of 2000 bikes in that one area alone.
No, and this might be contracersial but Van Gogh struck me as a struggling hack. He could paint, but not even amazingly well in comparison to his contemporaries of the time. Also he painted whatever was in front of him, people, fruit, flowers. He did not appear to have any imagination of his own, no inspiration other than what was right in front of him. It is as if he is only famous due to his brother being an art dealer and also such a large body of work survives him. I am not saying his work is value-less but in terms of art I would consider it less inspirational than someone like Polliock.  
I wouldn't want to smoke out of that funky looking old thing.  It looks like something you would buy from the glass case at a truck stop.  get some glass brother.    And WTF is this about a "bad trip at a concert"?  are you fucking kidding me?  "Bad trip" on weed?  that is one of the most ridiculous things i have ever heard.
They look great, wish more of weedit posted pics of their grows :)
tl;dr let's smoke.
dank.
I'd like to see a glass bong shaped like a pineapple. 
[Context](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/15/martian-swirly/)
most Restaurants will go out of business in year one, hence this property being available I would guess. Bars will fare a little better especially if you are in a student area and offer cheap drinks, but term ends sometime and then you might have 3 months hemmoraging cash. 
Oh, I thought it was a chasm of ice for a minute.
You might want to spend a few bucks and get a new one. Or spend a hundred dollars or so and get a bong that lasts a lifetime.
I really want to know this, as I've heard the same 5 stories over and again for years, but I really don't want to click on HuffPo.
I [pineapple] you 
what are you talking about, I would take homey grown weed from BC or Cali any day...dutch coffee shop weed sucks in general, usually burns black...
I would hazard that you have never tried in Dutch coffeeshop weed.
I agree, I tend to think that most Cannabis in the Netherlands is mass produced for coffeeshops, so the quality just isn't there.
Marketing research and cost estimates are all speculation.  I agree that it's a terrible idea to go in half-cocked but why pay a bunch of middle men  to tell you a bunch of shit that isn't very useful?
This is awesome, thank you for sharing
&gt;I've had my eye on a resturant that wernt out of buisness  If I worked at a bank I'd flat-out deny you because you can't coherently ask for what you want.  Wernt?  That's not even a southern word.  **Restaurant, business, etc**.
alright guys im off for my voyage to Amsterdam. looking forward to an awesome time
what was your favorite coffeeshop that you visited? were you able to visit the van goh museum? or more importantly...the heineken museum?
oh and window shopping in red light?
I thought they were sandworms.
I'd place the lamps lower if I were you. They will grow too tall if you keep the lights all the way up there. I wish you luck, and congrats on deciding to grow your own.
It also matters where you live in the US. Each state seems to be different in good to bad strain ratio. Here in Texas if you are looking for some cheap bud, that can still get you high, (Smokes and tastes like shit) you get "swag" or technical terms "lows" they are going to be like $25 for half an once. Which is pretty good price but again it is Mexican Brick Weed and can taste, smoke, and smell like shit. Then you have really good strains here too. (AK, White Rhino, Grand Daddy Purple, ect.) and those will go for $20 a G which again I have heard is a pretty good price. I have never bought outside of Texas so I am not sure but I have been told by a lot of people bud is really cheap here. So to answer you question I would assume that around the world if you are looking in the right places you will always find good bud no matter if you are in the US or Netherlands. Now the price is what I would be wondering about.
Hey, the first time I smoked I thought I could not breath and was having a heart attack. People can have bad trips, man. It is just not as bad as say a bad trip on DXM or Acid. After my first bad trip on weed (also the first time I smoked weed) I did not want to do it again but after awhile I said "fuck it" and sparked up again. Ever since that day I have been smoking on the regular. You just have to remember that weed is your friend and a good green friend would never hurt you.  EDIT: That is an awesome old school pipe man! That is really sweet of you to restore her old pipe give it to her and be like "I did this just for you, and when you smoke with me you will never have a bad trip." but sadly I do not know how to fix the clay, I think it looks awesome the way it is now. But yeah I would use a steel wool and something that removes rust WD40 or w/e and then gently scrape the rust away but make sure not to gash the pipe up. 
Um, divided we fall? There were several of us at the original /r/MJ. Now we're spread out. That is why I mean by hurting the community.
Under no circumstances should you keep smoking out of that piece, let it go man.  Get. Some. Glass. 
that really is a poor pipe. you'd be better off with a new glass.  however i get that it has history and you want to resort it. your best option would be to replace as many parts as you can. the pipe seems to be a generic 'low end rockshop' type than can be found in most head shops. you should have no problem finding a replacement for the bowl and mouthpiece. i dont know from the pic if it would be possible to slide off the clay and put it on a new tube. but that would be ideal.  if not then scrubbing the inside with a wire brush and steelwool should make it usable. i would avoid wd-40 on the inside as you do plan to smoke out of it and the metal pipes can heat up even that far down.  
slightly more expensive that what i pay in vancouver. same strains available here. but grown by hippies with love. our mass-produced stuff goes mostly to the south of the boarder.  mmMMmmMm Diesel.
its an impossible question to answer.  'average' depends on who you talk to, where they are, and when.  great weed can and is grown in both. shwag can and is grown in both.  more than any other factors the quality of the weed is determined by strain and grower.   the strains available in both areas are generally the same for the popular ones. and based on the same strains for new local types.
New high, eh?  I see what you did there.
Round trip plane tickets are around $600. You would need a lot of money to spend there though because of the exchange rate. It's almost $1.50 for 1 Euro now. I just went 3 months ago but luckily I didn't have to pay for anything.
http://www.kayak.com/ is a good site that searches prices from a wide range of airline sites and other price aggregaters.
[Airdrawndagger, Sasha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airdrawndagger). Good spacey electronica. 
Were you in the Swords &amp; Ale guild?
I went back in 2000 for about a week.  I paid about 750 for my ticket.  I would budget a couple hundred a day for expenses.  You could do it much cheaper though if you stay in hostels and eat cheap.  I didn't.
I've been twice, trust me it's mostly crap **compared to what I am used to**  there are only maybe 6 shops worth going to
Dood! It's totally a real pineapple! I just noticed. High five everyone, high five! Great job.
Save it as a momentum. Glass all the way.. even marble.. such a cleaner, nicer smoke. i promise.
studying in the UK huh?? Me too, until Decemeber.. I am in Scotland, wbu?  Will be in Amsterdam starting tomorrow morning... will update you on financials once i return...
Wow, I love the term "treefolk!" :D  but I can't help you out, sorry.
I'm in the London area for three years. Just got here about a month ago. Have a great time, man. Definitely let me know any info whenever you can. I'm really hoping to go some time soon since I can't find any fucking weed here, and it's killing me like nothing else.
100 bucks a night on hotels, 100 bucks a day for food, weed and hash  there are private apartments available for rent too, usually a better deal  try to get out of the dam and see the countryside if can help it, it is a bit of a vortex
As a reply to the bad trip thing, the first time I got high was what I considered a bad trip. I was so incredibly out of it my whole night was in strobe lights, I could not remember anything, I kept passing out, and I threw up a lot in my friends driveway. Also, I climbed up on my friends grandmothers car. So yea, bad trip. 
Saw Mike this last weekend at Treasure Island.  Fucking Terrible. Not that i dont like the video though, he was just absolutely horrifyingly bad.  Left his stage and went to [this.](http://www.myspace.com/dandeacon)  
Besides the weed, what did you most enjoy about Amsterdam or the Netherlands in general? Did you buy shrooms and if so, where? They are illegal now. Where did you take them?  I've lived in Amsterdam and still visit practically everyday for my work but I would so love to spend a week as a tourist there. Wake up in a hotel room, smoke, breakfast, smoke, canal boat tour, smoke, etc.  
You can probably find me in the Abraxas shop Saturday afternoon. Send me a PM if you want to hook up for a drink.
I agree with keeping this pipe as a memento, and investing in some glass. WD-40 might absorb in existing resin or even the clay itself, and you *really* don't want to smoke that.  It's sweet of you to go out of your way to try and make your wife comfortable with smoking again. 
That guy was a dick. The few cops I've encountered aren't assholes like that. I guess I've lucked out.
Try telling that to the bank you wanna borrow from. See how they respond.  You don't have to pay a bunch of middle men.  You can do most of your own research.  But you gotta do the research, it isn't really an option. 
and treants. good terms
[momentum](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/momentum)?  i think you mean [memento](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/memento).
I have smoked prodigious amounts of weed over the last 15 years and I have never *tripped* so i don't know how you could have a *bad trip*.  The closest I can say I came to a bad trip was when I was in high school.  I didn't smoke much back then, and I was hanging out with some friends that liked to smoke *tough*.  I just got too high too function, and i had my friend drop me off at home and i slept all afternoon.  It wasn't exactly traumatic.
Depends on where you want to stay and what you want to do I'd highly recommend (hostel wise) the Lucky Lake Hostel, its about a train ride + busride out of amsterdam so if you want to do things in the late of the night its probably not for you.  I'd say anywhere from 600-1000 on the flight, depending on how soon you buy your tickets. I'd bring about 1k spending money (but I went for 3 days last time and spent maybe 100-200 a day).
My new setup is going to be: A growlab 80L, 2'7"x4'11"x6'7" WLH.   2x600w HPS lights, digital/dimmable ballast 2x air cooled reflectors can fan/filter with all the little accessories, dirt, nutes, i'm pushing $1600.  But I could push a pound out of that on the first run, and most likely more. Save your money, do it right!

written whilst really stoned, edited now, grammar Nazi
Sweet, man, got anything special to celebrate with?
Lol, not smoking really isn't that hard to do. Just keep yourself occupied
Stay busy and put whatever stash you have somewhere that's inconvenient to get at. I used to keep mine on my desk which really didn't help when I was trying to take a break.
or until some stoned/drunk ass fool knocks it over or drops it.
noice... my friend did that at a music festival this weekend.  probly not a good idea after consuming 2 bottles of wine each.  how you gonna do it? pepe? bwongsky? bubbbla? vapoorizer?
Hope you have fun man! I got high as FUCK after I got off my 90 day probation. I didnt think my tolerance was so high when I was smoking before, but I sure was wrong!
Then either make them pay for it, or let untrustable people get anywhere near your bong. It's not any more complicated than that. 
I like upvoting a submission in order to make it a pineapple then quickly downvoting it to give it rocket propulsion then rapidly upvoting the submissions above it to see the pineapple soar to the top of the page. 
Being high doesn't make you illiterate.
not i said the duck
I watched this entire series a few months back. I remember thinking what an entitled, snobby bitch Hamilton was, but being amused and generally appreciative of being able to watch the entire experience. 
Mmmm. Looks tasty.
word to that, i see it as personal style  definitely like to see somebody rip the shit out of a bong, yet also i can appreciate the slow milker who exhales before getting brainfucked
Mmmm. Looks tasty.
did you kill that poor little butterfly?! **MURDERER!!!**
really kind of a mind over matter thing  id say though that once you get started its pretty easy to keep going just as long as you don't have any supply or constant boredom  just remember how fucking high you're gonna be come this Friday night (or whenever haha)
NOOOOOOOO!!!!
what was her name 
One of my friends told me about this while I was super I could not stop laughing. So crazy...I live in a college town where there are bikes everywhere but fuck that sounds like a lot of bikes.

Listen man, the whole network of subreddits idea does not sound appealing to me. Why should I join like 3 subreddits? For what reason? I understand b34nz is a fucktard but that doesn't mean every mod is a power-hungry bigot.   And how many people do you plan on having on each subreddit? This whole thing just makes no sense to me. Decentralization? Wtf?  And honestly, you are a very shady character. I would never trust you in power. You pretty much spammed this thread with your propaganda and then deleted it all. You compared cinsere to HITLER. What the fuck Mr. Fox News. And what the fuck  &gt;**I think it is obvious that many people here don't know what's going on, just like how they don't know what occurred with b34nz in earnest.** Yet, they're quick to make uninformed determinations.  is that supposed to mean?   Listen, I'm done with your shit. I took this long to answer because it's my day off and I was high. Therefore, I really didn't wanna deal with this shit. Wtf is up with you? What do you think of when you smoke?   I won't waste any more time on you.
I actually dropped my bubbler in my bathroom the other day. It smacked into the side of the tub from a few feet above it. I am probably going to have to pay for the chipped paint on the tub, but my bubbler turned out fine. Sorry for your bad luck.
    It's coming through a hole in the air,     from those nights in Tiananmen Square.     It's coming from the feel     that this ain't exactly real,     or it's real, but it ain't exactly there.     From the wars against disorder,     from the sirens night and day,     from the fires of the homeless,     from the ashes of the gay:     Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.     It's coming through a crack in the wall;     on a visionary flood of alcohol;     from the staggering account     of the Sermon on the Mount     which I don't pretend to understand at all.     It's coming from the silence     on the dock of the bay,     from the brave, the bold, the battered     heart of Chevrolet:     Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.      It's coming from the sorrow in the street,     the holy places where the races meet;     from the homicidal bitchin'     that goes down in every kitchen     to determine who will serve and who will eat.     From the wells of disappointment     where the women kneel to pray     for the grace of God in the desert here     and the desert far away:     Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 
I'm trying too! I'm not doing so good though...
smoke your entire stash, buy some at the end of your break.
Smoke weed.
Just a few days ago my friend dropped his brand new, $50, glass-on-glass bong slide onto the ceramic of his bathroom. You get what you pay for, because the only damage it had to speak of was a tiny little nick on it.
sigh.... been there brother. 
Nooo! I feel your pain, brotha.
im so sorry for your loss i say we set up a midnight candlelight vigil in its memory
I would suggest using Propylene Glycol, the stuff they use in Smoke machines. It is relatively safe to inhale, otherwise it wouldn't be used in smoke machines, and is a solvent that will dissolve cannabinoid oils.   It is also the carrier they use in electronic cigarettes.
My problem whenever I take a break is that I can't fall asleep at all without it! Man, I need to fix that :/

Yeah I'll get sick if I smoke after getting drunk but I'm fine if I drink after being baked.
it does if you are dyslexic
I hate saying it, but glass piece's never last forever.  R.I.P.
This first thing that came to my head when I read the title of this submission was, "Hell yeah!"  Congrats bro and have a good fuckin' time!
Thor's Hammer was the name. R.I.P (Thor's Hammer)
You could make a song from that photo.
His name was Thor's Hammer.... His name was Thor's Hammer....
No, Thor's Hammer is an "it", cause Thor's Hammer is an object. But not anymore. :&lt;
SAY *WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA???*
Don't tell me this now, man. Not **NOW**, man!!!
THAT PIPE ONLY HAD THREE DAYS LEFT UNTIL RETIREMENT!
Try a yoga class, assists with faster detox (sweat) and will help you sleep. Most places have free trials or super cheap starting classes for newbz.
that's usually the hardest part about tolerance breaks.   Vigorous exercise, chamomile teas and yoga work good for that.
If you guys would like to, spark one up just for the loss of a fellow pipe.  R.I.P (Thor's Hammer)
I did Bikram yoga (yoga in 105-110 degree heat) with my sister and she made fun of me for days because while most people just smelled like BO, I reeked like weed. she said it reminded her of the smell of weed butter when it's cooking. haha I couldn't smell it because I'm immune to both the smell of myself and weed. apparently THC stores in lipids because it is one, so as I was burning fat it was seeping out through my pores. 
Is there a lot of drug testing in the US?  Here in Canada, it's only police, firefighters and truck drivers than can have the dreaded random test.  Just curious because I see these often.  Also, what about drinking cranberry juice?
Hmm... next time I have some disposable income, I'm going to try and devise a thc cartridge for those electronic cigarettes.  I've searched before and to my knowledge no one has attempted it yet.
Smoking out of Pepe? Is that like doing shotties?
Same here - Melatonin helps me with it, though. It might be worth a try.
Me too. I remember listening to it in the car for the first time and being like ~whoa, dude~; that cd is beyond description.
